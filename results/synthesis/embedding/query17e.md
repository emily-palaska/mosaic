### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_mahalanobis_distances.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate data  First, we generate a dataset of 125 samples and 2 features. Both features are Gaussian distributed with mean of 0 but feature
1 has a standard deviation equal to 2 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 1. Next, 25 samples are replaced with Gaussian outlier samples
where feature 1 has a standard deviation equal to 1 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 7.   COMMENT:
```python
np.random.seed(7)
n_samples = 125
n_outliers = 25
n_features = 2
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_cluster_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Comparing different clustering algorithms on toy datasets  This example shows characteristics of different clustering algorithms on
datasets that are "interesting" but still in 2D. With the exception of the last dataset, the parameters of each of these dataset-algorithm pairs has
been tuned to produce good clustering results. Some algorithms are more sensitive to parameter values than others.  The last dataset is an example of
a 'null' situation for clustering: the data is homogeneous, and there is no good clustering. For this example, the null dataset uses the same
parameters as the dataset in the row above it, which represents a mismatch in the parameter values and the data structure.  While these examples give
some intuition about the algorithms, this intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data.  COMMENT: catch warnings related to
