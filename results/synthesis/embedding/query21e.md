### notebooks/dataset2/decision_trees/plot_cost_complexity_pruning.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Post pruning decision trees with cost complexity pruning  .. currentmodule:: sklearn.tree  The :class:`DecisionTreeClassifier` provides
parameters such as ``min_samples_leaf`` and ``max_depth`` to prevent a tree from overfiting. Cost complexity pruning provides another option to
control the size of a tree. In :class:`DecisionTreeClassifier`, this pruning technique is parameterized by the cost complexity parameter,
``ccp_alpha``. Greater values of ``ccp_alpha`` increase the number of nodes pruned. Here we only show the effect of ``ccp_alpha`` on regularizing the
trees and how to choose a ``ccp_alpha`` based on validation scores.  See also `minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details on pruning.  COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_covariance_estimation.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Compare different approaches to setting the regularization parameter  Here we compare 3 approaches:  * Setting the parameter by cross-
validating the likelihood on three folds   according to a grid of potential shrinkage parameters.  * A close formula proposed by Ledoit and Wolf to
compute   the asymptotically optimal regularization parameter (minimizing a MSE   criterion), yielding the :class:`~sklearn.covariance.LedoitWolf`
covariance estimate.  * An improvement of the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage, the   :class:`~sklearn.covariance.OAS`, proposed by Chen et al. Its   convergence
is significantly better under the assumption that the data   are Gaussian, in particular for small samples.   COMMENT: OAS coefficient estimate

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Calibration curves  Below, we train each of the four models with the small training dataset, then plot calibration curves (also known as
reliability diagrams) using predicted probabilities of the test dataset. Calibration curves are created by binning predicted probabilities, then
plotting the mean predicted probability in each bin against the observed frequency ('fraction of positives'). Below the calibration curve, we plot a
histogram showing the distribution of the predicted probabilities or more specifically, the number of samples in each predicted probability bin.
