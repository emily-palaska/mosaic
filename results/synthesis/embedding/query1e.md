### notebooks/dataset2/dataset_examples/plot_random_multilabel_dataset.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Plot randomly generated multilabel dataset  This illustrates the :func:`~sklearn.datasets.make_multilabel_classification` dataset
generator. Each sample consists of counts of two features (up to 50 in total), which are differently distributed in each of two classes.  Points are
labeled as follows, where Y means the class is present:  =====  =====  =====  ======   1      2      3    Color =====  =====  =====  ======   Y      N
N    Red   N      Y      N    Blue   N      N      Y    Yellow   Y      Y      N    Purple   Y      N      Y    Orange   Y      Y      N    Green   Y
Y      Y    Brown =====  =====  =====  ======  A star marks the expected sample for each class; its size reflects the probability of selecting that
class label.  The left and right examples highlight the ``n_labels`` parameter: more of the samples in the right plot have 2 or 3 labels.  Note that
this two-dimensional example is very degenerate: generally the number of features would be much greater than the "document length", while here we have
much larger documents than vocabulary. Similarly, with ``n_classes > n_features``, it is much less likely that a feature distinguishes a particular
class.  COMMENT: purple

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_calibration_multiclass.ipynb
CONTEXT: According to the Brier score, the calibrated classifier is not better than the original model.  Finally we generate a grid of possible
uncalibrated probabilities over the 2-simplex, compute the corresponding calibrated probabilities and plot arrows for each. The arrows are colored
according the highest uncalibrated probability. This illustrates the learned calibration map:   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_faces_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Decomposition: Dictionary learning  In the further section, let's consider `DictionaryLearning` more precisely. Dictionary learning is a
problem that amounts to finding a sparse representation of the input data as a combination of simple elements. These simple elements form a
dictionary. It is possible to constrain the dictionary and/or coding coefficients to be positive to match constraints that may be present in the data.
:class:`~sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning` implements a faster, but less accurate version of the dictionary learning algorithm that
is better suited for large datasets. Read more in the `User Guide <MiniBatchDictionaryLearning>`.  Plot the same samples from our dataset but with
another colormap. Red indicates negative values, blue indicates positive values, and white represents zeros.   COMMENT:
```python
plot_gallery("Faces from dataset", faces_centered[:n_components], cmap=plt.cm.RdBu)
