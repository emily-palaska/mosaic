## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Predict the value of the digit on the test subset
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
```

```

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_mahalanobis_distances.ipynb
CONTEXT: To better visualize the difference, we plot contours of the Mahalanobis distances calculated by both methods. Notice that the robust MCD
based Mahalanobis distances fit the inlier black points much better, whereas the MLE based distances are more influenced by the outlier red points.
COMMENT: Calculate the MCD based Mahalanobis distances
```python
ax.legend(
    [
        mlines.Line2D([], [], color="tab:blue", linestyle="dashed"),
        mlines.Line2D([], [], color="tab:orange", linestyle="dotted"),
        inlier_plot,
        outlier_plot,
    ],
    ["MLE dist", "MCD dist", "inliers", "outliers"],
    loc="upper right",
    borderaxespad=0,
)
plt.show()
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
predicted = clf.predict(X_test)
n_samples = len(digits.images)
data = digits.images.reshape((n_samples, -1))
ax.legend(
    [
        mlines.Line2D([], [], color="tab:blue", linestyle="dashed"),
        mlines.Line2D([], [], color="tab:orange", linestyle="dotted"),
        inlier_plot,
