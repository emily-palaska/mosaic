### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_kmeans_digits.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Define our evaluation benchmark  We will first our evaluation benchmark. During this benchmark, we intend to compare different
initialization methods for KMeans. Our benchmark will:  * create a pipeline which will scale the data using a
:class:`~sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`; * train and time the pipeline fitting; * measure the performance of the clustering obtained via
different metrics.   COMMENT: Define the metrics which require only the true labels and estimator labels The silhouette score requires the full
dataset Show the results

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering_metrics.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with different metrics  Demonstrates the effect of different metrics on the hierarchical clustering.  The example
is engineered to show the effect of the choice of different metrics. It is applied to waveforms, which can be seen as high-dimensional vector. Indeed,
the difference between metrics is usually more pronounced in high dimension (in particular for euclidean and cityblock).  We generate data from three
groups of waveforms. Two of the waveforms (waveform 1 and waveform 2) are proportional one to the other. The cosine distance is invariant to a scaling
of the data, as a result, it cannot distinguish these two waveforms. Thus even with no noise, clustering using this distance will not separate out
waveform 1 and 2.  We add observation noise to these waveforms. We generate very sparse noise: only 6% of the time points contain noise. As a result,
the l1 norm of this noise (ie "cityblock" distance) is much smaller than its l2 norm ("euclidean" distance). This can be seen on the inter-class
distance matrices: the values on the diagonal, that characterize the spread of the class, are much bigger for the Euclidean distance than for the
cityblock distance.  When we apply clustering to the data, we find that the clustering reflects what was in the distance matrices. Indeed, for the
Euclidean distance, the classes are ill-separated because of the noise, and thus the clustering does not separate the waveforms. For the cityblock
distance, the separation is good and the waveform classes are recovered. Finally, the cosine distance does not separate at all waveform 1 and 2, thus
the clustering puts them in the same cluster.  COMMENT:
