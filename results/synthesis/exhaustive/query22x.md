## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Selecting the number of clusters with silhouette analysis on KMeans clustering  Silhouette analysis can be used to study the separation
distance between the resulting clusters. The silhouette plot displays a measure of how close each point in one cluster is to points in the neighboring
clusters and thus provides a way to assess parameters like number of clusters visually. This measure has a range of [-1, 1].  Silhouette coefficients
(as these values are referred to as) near +1 indicate that the sample is far away from the neighboring clusters. A value of 0 indicates that the
sample is on or very close to the decision boundary between two neighboring clusters and negative values indicate that those samples might have been
assigned to the wrong cluster.  In this example the silhouette analysis is used to choose an optimal value for ``n_clusters``. The silhouette plot
shows that the ``n_clusters`` value of 3, 5 and 6 are a bad pick for the given data due to the presence of clusters with below average silhouette
scores and also due to wide fluctuations in the size of the silhouette plots. Silhouette analysis is more ambivalent in deciding between 2 and 4.
Also from the thickness of the silhouette plot the cluster size can be visualized. The silhouette plot for cluster 0 when ``n_clusters`` is equal to
2, is bigger in size owing to the grouping of the 3 sub clusters into one big cluster. However when the ``n_clusters`` is equal to 4, all the plots
are more or less of similar thickness and hence are of similar sizes as can be also verified from the labelled scatter plot on the right.  COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/biclustering/plot_spectral_biclustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fitting `SpectralBiclustering` We fit the model and compare the obtained clusters with the ground truth. Note that when creating the model
we specify the same number of clusters that we used to create the dataset (`n_clusters = (4, 3)`), which will contribute to obtain a good result.

```python
score = consensus_score(
    model.biclusters_, (rows[:, row_idx_shuffled], columns[:, col_idx_shuffled])
