## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_faces_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT: Define a base function to plot the gallery of faces.   COMMENT:
```python
n_row, n_col = 2, 3
n_components = n_row * n_col
image_shape = (64, 64)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_cluster_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Comparing different clustering algorithms on toy datasets  This example shows characteristics of different clustering algorithms on
datasets that are "interesting" but still in 2D. With the exception of the last dataset, the parameters of each of these dataset-algorithm pairs has
been tuned to produce good clustering results. Some algorithms are more sensitive to parameter values than others.  The last dataset is an example of
a 'null' situation for clustering: the data is homogeneous, and there is no good clustering. For this example, the null dataset uses the same
parameters as the dataset in the row above it, which represents a mismatch in the parameter values and the data structure.  While these examples give
some intuition about the algorithms, this intuition might not apply to very high dimensional data.  COMMENT: connectivity matrix for structured Ward
```python
    connectivity = kneighbors_graph(
        X, n_neighbors=params["n_neighbors"], include_self=False
    )
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_face_compress.ipynb
CONTEXT: The counts in the bins are now more balanced and their centers are no longer equally spaced. Note that we could enforce the same number of
pixels per bin by using the `strategy="quantile"` instead of `strategy="kmeans"`.   Memory footprint  We previously stated that we should save 8 times
less memory. Let's verify it.   COMMENT:
```python
print(f"The number of bytes taken in RAM is {compressed_raccoon_kmeans.nbytes}")
print(f"Compression ratio: {compressed_raccoon_kmeans.nbytes / raccoon_face.nbytes}")
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
n_row, n_col = 2, 3
n_components = n_row * n_col
image_shape = (64, 64)
    connectivity = kneighbors_graph(
        X, n_neighbors=params["n_neighbors"], include_self=False
    )
print(f"The number of bytes taken in RAM is {compressed_raccoon_kmeans.nbytes}")
print(f"Compression ratio: {compressed_raccoon_kmeans.nbytes / raccoon_face.nbytes}")
