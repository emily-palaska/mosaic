## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/decision_trees/plot_iris_dtc.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Plot the decision surface of decision trees trained on the iris dataset  Plot the decision surface of a decision tree trained on pairs of
features of the iris dataset.  See `decision tree <tree>` for more information on the estimator.  For each pair of iris features, the decision tree
learns decision boundaries made of combinations of simple thresholding rules inferred from the training samples.  We also show the tree structure of a
model built on all of the features.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
