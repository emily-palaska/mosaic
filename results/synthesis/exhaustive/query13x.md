## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_select_from_model_diabetes.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Selecting features based on importance  Now we want to select the two features which are the most important according to the coefficients.
The :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` is meant just for that. :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` accepts a
`threshold` parameter and will select the features whose importance (defined by the coefficients) are above this threshold.  Since we want to select
only 2 features, we will set this threshold slightly above the coefficient of third most important feature.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector
tic_fwd = time()
sfs_forward = SequentialFeatureSelector(
    ridge, n_features_to_select=2, direction="forward"
).fit(X, y)
toc_fwd = time()
tic_bwd = time()
sfs_backward = SequentialFeatureSelector(
    ridge, n_features_to_select=2, direction="backward"
).fit(X, y)
toc_bwd = time()
print(
    "Features selected by forward sequential selection: "
    f"{feature_names[sfs_forward.get_support()]}"
)
print(f"Done in {toc_fwd - tic_fwd:.3f}s")
print(
    "Features selected by backward sequential selection: "
    f"{feature_names[sfs_backward.get_support()]}"
)
print(f"Done in {toc_bwd - tic_bwd:.3f}s")
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_feature_agglomeration_vs_univariate_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT: Anova univariate feature selection followed by BayesianRidge   COMMENT: set the best parameters
```python
clf.fit(X, y)
```
