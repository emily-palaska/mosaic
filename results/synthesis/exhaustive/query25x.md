## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_birch_vs_minibatchkmeans.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Compare BIRCH and MiniBatchKMeans  This example compares the timing of BIRCH (with and without the global clustering step) and
MiniBatchKMeans on a synthetic dataset having 25,000 samples and 2 features generated using make_blobs.  Both ``MiniBatchKMeans`` and ``BIRCH`` are
very scalable algorithms and could run efficiently on hundreds of thousands or even millions of datapoints. We chose to limit the dataset size of this
example in the interest of keeping our Continuous Integration resource usage reasonable but the interested reader might enjoy editing this script to
rerun it with a larger value for `n_samples`.  If ``n_clusters`` is set to None, the data is reduced from 25,000 samples to a set of 158 clusters.
This can be viewed as a preprocessing step before the final (global) clustering step that further reduces these 158 clusters to 100 clusters.
COMMENT: Use all colors that matplotlib provides by default.
```python
colors_ = cycle(colors.cnames.keys())
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.04, right=0.98, bottom=0.1, top=0.9)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_optics.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Demo of OPTICS clustering algorithm  .. currentmodule:: sklearn  Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. This
example uses data that is generated so that the clusters have different densities.  The :class:`~cluster.OPTICS` is first used with its Xi cluster
detection method, and then setting specific thresholds on the reachability, which corresponds to :class:`~cluster.DBSCAN`. We can see that the
different clusters of OPTICS's Xi method can be recovered with different choices of thresholds in DBSCAN.  COMMENT: DBSCAN at 0.5
```python
colors = ["g.", "r.", "b.", "c."]
for klass, color in enumerate(colors):
    Xk = X[labels_050 == klass]
    ax3.plot(Xk[:, 0], Xk[:, 1], color, alpha=0.3)
ax3.plot(X[labels_050 == -1, 0], X[labels_050 == -1, 1], "k+", alpha=0.1)
ax3.set_title("Clustering at 0.5 epsilon cut\nDBSCAN")
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
colors_ = cycle(colors.cnames.keys())
fig = plt.figure(figsize=(12, 4))
fig.subplots_adjust(left=0.04, right=0.98, bottom=0.1, top=0.9)
colors = ["g.", "r.", "b.", "c."]
for klass, color in enumerate(colors):
    Xk = X[labels_050 == klass]
    ax3.plot(Xk[:, 0], Xk[:, 1], color, alpha=0.3)
ax3.plot(X[labels_050 == -1, 0], X[labels_050 == -1, 1], "k+", alpha=0.1)
ax3.set_title("Clustering at 0.5 epsilon cut\nDBSCAN")
```
