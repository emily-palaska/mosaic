## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_coin_segmentation.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Segmenting the picture of greek coins in regions  This example uses `spectral_clustering` on a graph created from voxel-to-voxel difference
on an image to break this image into multiple partly-homogeneous regions.  This procedure (spectral clustering on an image) is an efficient
approximate solution for finding normalized graph cuts.  There are three options to assign labels:  * 'kmeans' spectral clustering clusters samples in
the embedding space   using a kmeans algorithm * 'discrete' iteratively searches for the closest partition   space to the embedding space of spectral
clustering. * 'cluster_qr' assigns labels using the QR factorization with pivoting   that directly determines the partition in the embedding space.
COMMENT: The number of segmented regions to display needs to be chosen manually. The current version of 'spectral_clustering' does not support
determining the number of good quality clusters automatically.
```python
n_regions = 26
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_optics.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Demo of OPTICS clustering algorithm  .. currentmodule:: sklearn  Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. This
example uses data that is generated so that the clusters have different densities.  The :class:`~cluster.OPTICS` is first used with its Xi cluster
detection method, and then setting specific thresholds on the reachability, which corresponds to :class:`~cluster.DBSCAN`. We can see that the
different clusters of OPTICS's Xi method can be recovered with different choices of thresholds in DBSCAN.  COMMENT: OPTICS
```python
colors = ["g.", "r.", "b.", "y.", "c."]
for klass, color in enumerate(colors):
    Xk = X[clust.labels_ == klass]
    ax2.plot(Xk[:, 0], Xk[:, 1], color, alpha=0.3)
ax2.plot(X[clust.labels_ == -1, 0], X[clust.labels_ == -1, 1], "k+", alpha=0.1)
ax2.set_title("Automatic Clustering\nOPTICS")
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
n_regions = 26
colors = ["g.", "r.", "b.", "y.", "c."]
for klass, color in enumerate(colors):
    Xk = X[clust.labels_ == klass]
    ax2.plot(Xk[:, 0], Xk[:, 1], color, alpha=0.3)
ax2.plot(X[clust.labels_ == -1, 0], X[clust.labels_ == -1, 1], "k+", alpha=0.1)
ax2.set_title("Automatic Clustering\nOPTICS")
