### notebooks/dataset2/decision_trees/plot_cost_complexity_pruning.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Post pruning decision trees with cost complexity pruning  .. currentmodule:: sklearn.tree  The :class:`DecisionTreeClassifier` provides
parameters such as ``min_samples_leaf`` and ``max_depth`` to prevent a tree from overfiting. Cost complexity pruning provides another option to
control the size of a tree. In :class:`DecisionTreeClassifier`, this pruning technique is parameterized by the cost complexity parameter,
``ccp_alpha``. Greater values of ``ccp_alpha`` increase the number of nodes pruned. Here we only show the effect of ``ccp_alpha`` on regularizing the
trees and how to choose a ``ccp_alpha`` based on validation scores.  See also `minimal_cost_complexity_pruning` for details on pruning.  COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/decision_trees/plot_unveil_tree_structure.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Tree structure  The decision classifier has an attribute called ``tree_`` which allows access to low level attributes such as
``node_count``, the total number of nodes, and ``max_depth``, the maximal depth of the tree. The ``tree_.compute_node_depths()`` method computes the
depth of each node in the tree. `tree_` also stores the entire binary tree structure, represented as a number of parallel arrays. The i-th element of
each array holds information about the node ``i``. Node 0 is the tree's root. Some of the arrays only apply to either leaves or split nodes. In this
case the values of the nodes of the other type is arbitrary. For example, the arrays ``feature`` and ``threshold`` only apply to split nodes. The
values for leaf nodes in these arrays are therefore arbitrary.  Among these arrays, we have:  - ``children_left[i]``: id of the left child of node
``i`` or -1 if leaf node - ``children_right[i]``: id of the right child of node ``i`` or -1 if leaf node - ``feature[i]``: feature used for splitting
node ``i`` - ``threshold[i]``: threshold value at node ``i`` - ``n_node_samples[i]``: the number of training samples reaching node ``i`` -
``impurity[i]``: the impurity at node ``i`` - ``weighted_n_node_samples[i]``: the weighted number of training samples   reaching node ``i`` -
``value[i, j, k]``: the summary of the training samples that reached node i for   output j and class k (for regression tree, class is set to 1). See
below   for more information about ``value``.  Using the arrays, we can traverse the tree structure to compute various properties. Below, we will
compute the depth of each node and whether or not it is a leaf.   COMMENT:
