### notebooks/dataset2/biclustering/plot_bicluster_newsgroups.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Biclustering documents with the Spectral Co-clustering algorithm  This example demonstrates the Spectral Co-clustering algorithm on the
twenty newsgroups dataset. The 'comp.os.ms-windows.misc' category is excluded because it contains many posts containing nothing but data.  The TF-IDF
vectorized posts form a word frequency matrix, which is then biclustered using Dhillon's Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. The resulting document-word
biclusters indicate subsets words used more often in those subsets documents.  For a few of the best biclusters, its most common document categories
and its ten most important words get printed. The best biclusters are determined by their normalized cut. The best words are determined by comparing
their sums inside and outside the bicluster.  For comparison, the documents are also clustered using MiniBatchKMeans. The document clusters derived
from the biclusters achieve a better V-measure than clusters found by MiniBatchKMeans.  COMMENT:
