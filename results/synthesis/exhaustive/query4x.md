### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_compare_cross_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Compare cross decomposition methods  Simple usage of various cross decomposition algorithms:  - PLSCanonical - PLSRegression, with
multivariate response, a.k.a. PLS2 - PLSRegression, with univariate response, a.k.a. PLS1 - CCA  Given 2 multivariate covarying two-dimensional
datasets, X, and Y, PLS extracts the 'directions of covariance', i.e. the components of each datasets that explain the most shared variance between
both datasets. This is apparent on the **scatterplot matrix** display: components 1 in dataset X and dataset Y are maximally correlated (points lie
around the first diagonal). This is also true for components 2 in both dataset, however, the correlation across datasets for different components is
weak: the point cloud is very spherical.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_kmeans_digits.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Visualize the results on PCA-reduced data  :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` allows to project the data from the original 64-dimensional
space into a lower dimensional space. Subsequently, we can use :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` to project into a 2-dimensional space and plot the
data and the clusters in this new space.   COMMENT: Plot the centroids as a white X
```python
centroids = kmeans.cluster_centers_
plt.scatter(
    centroids[:, 0],
    centroids[:, 1],
    marker="x",
    s=169,
    linewidths=3,
    color="w",
    zorder=10,
)
plt.title(
    "K-means clustering on the digits dataset (PCA-reduced data)\n"
    "Centroids are marked with white cross"
)
plt.xlim(x_min, x_max)
plt.ylim(y_min, y_max)
plt.xticks(())
plt.yticks(())
plt.show()
```
