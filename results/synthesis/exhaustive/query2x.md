CONTEXT:   Decision Tree Regression with AdaBoost  A decision tree is boosted using the AdaBoost.R2 [1]_ algorithm on a 1D sinusoidal dataset with a
small amount of Gaussian noise. 299 boosts (300 decision trees) is compared with a single decision tree regressor. As the number of boosts is
increased the regressor can fit more detail.  See `sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_hgbt_regression.py` for an example showcasing the benefits of
using more efficient regression models such as :class:`~ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor`.  .. [1] [H. Drucker, "Improving Regressors using
Boosting Techniques", 1997.](https://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/doc_view/pid/8d49e2dedb817f2c3330e74b63c5fc86d2399ce3)  Preparing the data First, we
prepare dummy data with a sinusoidal relationship and some gaussian noise.   COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier:

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_hgbt_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT: With just a few iterations, HGBT models can achieve convergence (see
`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`), meaning that adding more trees does not improve the model anymore. In
the figure above, 5 iterations are not enough to get good predictions. With 50 iterations, we are already able to do a good job.  Setting `max_iter`
too high might degrade the prediction quality and cost a lot of avoidable computing resources. Therefore, the HGBT implementation in scikit-learn
provides an automatic **early stopping** strategy. With it, the model uses a fraction of the training data as internal validation set
(`validation_fraction`) and stops training if the validation score does not improve (or degrades) after `n_iter_no_change` iterations up to a certain
tolerance (`tol`).  Notice that there is a trade-off between `learning_rate` and `max_iter`: Generally, smaller learning rates are preferable but
require more iterations to converge to the minimum loss, while larger learning rates converge faster (less iterations/trees needed) but at the cost of
a larger minimum loss.  Because of this high correlation between the learning rate the number of iterations, a good practice is to tune the learning
rate along with all (important) other hyperparameters, fit the HBGT on the training set with a large enough value for `max_iter` and determine the
best `max_iter` via early stopping and some explicit `validation_fraction`.   COMMENT:
