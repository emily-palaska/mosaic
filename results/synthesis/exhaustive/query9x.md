## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Estimate the covariance   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_lda.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Normal, Ledoit-Wolf and OAS Linear Discriminant Analysis for classification  This example illustrates how the Ledoit-Wolf and Oracle
Approximating Shrinkage (OAS) estimators of covariance can improve classification.  COMMENT: how often to repeat classification
```python
n_averages = 50
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
n_averages = 50
```
