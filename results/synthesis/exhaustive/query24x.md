### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_adaboost_multiclass.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Analysis Convergence of the `AdaBoostClassifier` *************************************** To demonstrate the effectiveness of boosting in
improving accuracy, we evaluate the misclassification error of the boosted trees in comparison to two baseline scores. The first baseline score is the
`misclassification_error` obtained from a single weak-learner (i.e. :class:`~sklearn.tree.DecisionTreeClassifier`), which serves as a reference point.
The second baseline score is obtained from the :class:`~sklearn.dummy.DummyClassifier`, which predicts the most prevalent class in a dataset.
COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.dummy import DummyClassifier
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score
dummy_clf = DummyClassifier()
```

dropped:   COMMENT:

dropper = make_column_transformer(
