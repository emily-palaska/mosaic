CONTEXT:   Probability Calibration curves  When performing classification one often wants to predict not only the class label, but also the associated
probability. This probability gives some kind of confidence on the prediction. This example demonstrates how to visualize how well calibrated the
predicted probabilities are using calibration curves, also known as reliability diagrams. Calibration of an uncalibrated classifier will also be
demonstrated.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
