### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_covariance_estimation.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Shrinkage covariance estimation: LedoitWolf vs OAS and max-likelihood  When working with covariance estimation, the usual approach is to
use a maximum likelihood estimator, such as the :class:`~sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance`. It is unbiased, i.e. it converges to the true
(population) covariance when given many observations. However, it can also be beneficial to regularize it, in order to reduce its variance; this, in
turn, introduces some bias. This example illustrates the simple regularization used in `shrunk_covariance` estimators. In particular, it focuses on
how to set the amount of regularization, i.e. how to choose the bias-variance trade-off.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-
