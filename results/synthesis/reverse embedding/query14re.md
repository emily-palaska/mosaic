CONTEXT:   Robust vs Empirical covariance estimate  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate is very sensitive to the presence of outliers in
the data set. In such a case, it would be better to use a robust estimator of covariance to guarantee that the estimation is resistant to "erroneous"
observations in the data set. [1]_, [2]_   Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator is a robust, high-
breakdown point (i.e. it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of highly contaminated datasets, up to $\frac{n_\text{samples} -
n_\text{features}-1}{2}$ outliers) estimator of covariance. The idea is to find $\frac{n_\text{samples} + n_\text{features}+1}{2}$ observations whose
empirical covariance has the smallest determinant, yielding a "pure" subset of observations from which to compute standards estimates of location and
covariance. After a correction step aiming at compensating the fact that the estimates were learned from only a portion of the initial data, we end up
with robust estimates of the data set location and covariance.  The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator (MCD) has been introduced by P.J.Rousseuw
in [3]_.   Evaluation In this example, we compare the estimation errors that are made when using various types of location and covariance estimates on
contaminated Gaussian distributed data sets:  - The mean and the empirical covariance of the full dataset, which break   down as soon as there are
outliers in the data set - The robust MCD, that has a low error provided   $n_\text{samples} > 5n_\text{features}$ - The mean and the empirical
covariance of the observations that are known   to be good ones. This can be considered as a "perfect" MCD estimation,   so one can trust our
implementation by comparing to this case.    References .. [1] Johanna Hardin, David M Rocke. The distribution of robust distances.     Journal of

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Calibration curves  Below, we train each of the four models with the small training dataset, then plot calibration curves (also known as
reliability diagrams) using predicted probabilities of the test dataset. Calibration curves are created by binning predicted probabilities, then
plotting the mean predicted probability in each bin against the observed frequency ('fraction of positives'). Below the calibration curve, we plot a
histogram showing the distribution of the predicted probabilities or more specifically, the number of samples in each predicted probability bin.
COMMENT: Add histogram
```python
_ = [(2, 0), (2, 1), (3, 0), (3, 1)]
for i, (_, name) in enumerate(clf_list):
    _, col = _[i]
    ax = fig.add_subplot(gs[_, col])
    ax.hist(
        calibration_displays[name].y_prob,
        range=(0, 1),
        bins=10,
        label=name,
        color=colors(i),
    )
    ax.set(title=name, xlabel="Mean predicted probability", ylabel="Count")
