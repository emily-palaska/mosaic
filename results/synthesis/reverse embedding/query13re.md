CONTEXT: We will start by generating a binary classification dataset. Subsequently, we will divide the dataset into two subsets.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=3)
clf = LinearSVC()
anova_svm = make_pipeline(anova_filter, clf)
anova_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_robust_vs_empirical_covariance.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Robust vs Empirical covariance estimate  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate is very sensitive to the presence of outliers in
the data set. In such a case, it would be better to use a robust estimator of covariance to guarantee that the estimation is resistant to "erroneous"
observations in the data set. [1]_, [2]_   Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator is a robust, high-
breakdown point (i.e. it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of highly contaminated datasets, up to $\frac{n_\text{samples} -
n_\text{features}-1}{2}$ outliers) estimator of covariance. The idea is to find $\frac{n_\text{samples} + n_\text{features}+1}{2}$ observations whose
empirical covariance has the smallest determinant, yielding a "pure" subset of observations from which to compute standards estimates of location and
covariance. After a correction step aiming at compensating the fact that the estimates were learned from only a portion of the initial data, we end up
with robust estimates of the data set location and covariance.  The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator (MCD) has been introduced by P.J.Rousseuw
in [3]_.   Evaluation In this example, we compare the estimation errors that are made when using various types of location and covariance estimates on
contaminated Gaussian distributed data sets:  - The mean and the empirical covariance of the full dataset, which break   down as soon as there are
outliers in the data set - The robust MCD, that has a low error provided   $n_\text{samples} > 5n_\text{features}$ - The mean and the empirical
covariance of the observations that are known   to be good ones. This can be considered as a "perfect" MCD estimation,   so one can trust our
implementation by comparing to this case.    References .. [1] Johanna Hardin, David M Rocke. The distribution of robust distances.     Journal of
