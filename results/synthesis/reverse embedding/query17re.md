- n_features:<br>
>n_features is a variable that is used to specify the number of features that are used in the dataset
- np:<br>
>The variable np is a Python package that provides a large library of mathematical functions and data structures. It
- n_outliers:<br>
>n_outliers is the number of outliers that will be removed from the dataset. The outliers are the
- n_samples:<br>
>It is a random integer value that is used to generate a random sample of 125 data points.
- n_classes:<br>
>It is a constant that defines the number of classes in the dataset. In this case, it is
- plot_colors:<br>
>It is a list of colors used to represent the classes in the plot. The colors are defined by
- plot_step:<br>
>It is a value that is used to determine the step size of the plot. This value is used

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_mahalanobis_distances.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate data  First, we generate a dataset of 125 samples and 2 features. Both features are Gaussian distributed with mean of 0 but feature
1 has a standard deviation equal to 2 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 1. Next, 25 samples are replaced with Gaussian outlier samples
where feature 1 has a standard deviation equal to 1 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 7.   COMMENT:
```python
np.random.seed(7)
n_samples = 125
n_outliers = 25
n_features = 2
```
