## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_mahalanobis_distances.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate data  First, we generate a dataset of 125 samples and 2 features. Both features are Gaussian distributed with mean of 0 but feature
1 has a standard deviation equal to 2 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 1. Next, 25 samples are replaced with Gaussian outlier samples
where feature 1 has a standard deviation equal to 1 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 7.   COMMENT:
```python
np.random.seed(7)
n_samples = 125
n_outliers = 25
n_features = 2
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_pca_vs_fa_model_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fit the models   COMMENT: compare with other covariance estimators
```python
    plt.axhline(
        shrunk_cov_score(X),
        color="violet",
        label="Shrunk Covariance MLE",
        linestyle="-.",
    )
    plt.axhline(
        lw_score(X),
        color="orange",
        label="LedoitWolf MLE" % n_components_pca_mle,
        linestyle="-.",
    )
    plt.xlabel("nb of components")
    plt.ylabel("CV scores")
    plt.legend(loc="lower right")
