## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Estimate the covariance   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_varimax_fa.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Factor Analysis (with rotation) to visualize patterns  Investigating the Iris dataset, we see that sepal length, petal length and petal
width are highly correlated. Sepal width is less redundant. Matrix decomposition techniques can uncover these latent patterns. Applying rotations to
the resulting components does not inherently improve the predictive value of the derived latent space, but can help visualise their structure; here,
for example, the varimax rotation, which is found by maximizing the squared variances of the weights, finds a structure where the second component
only loads positively on sepal width.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_sparse_coding.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Sparse coding with a precomputed dictionary  Transform a signal as a sparse combination of Ricker wavelets. This example visually compares
different sparse coding methods using the :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.SparseCoder` estimator. The Ricker (also known as Mexican hat or the second
derivative of a Gaussian) is not a particularly good kernel to represent piecewise constant signals like this one. It can therefore be seen how much
adding different widths of atoms matters and it therefore motivates learning the dictionary to best fit your type of signals.  The richer dictionary
on the right is not larger in size, heavier subsampling is performed in order to stay on the same order of magnitude.  COMMENT:
```python
def ricker_matrix(width, resolution, n_components):    """Dictionary of Ricker (Mexican hat) wavelets"""    centers = np.linspace(0, resolution - 1, n_components)    D = np.empty((n_components, resolution))    for i, center in enumerate(centers):        D[i] = ricker_function(resolution, center, width)    D /= np.sqrt(np.sum(D**2, axis=1))[:, np.newaxis]    return D
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT: We can also plot a `confusion matrix <confusion_matrix>` of the true digit values and the predicted digit values.   COMMENT:
```python
disp = metrics.ConfusionMatrixDisplay.from_predictions(y_test, predicted)
disp.figure_.suptitle("Confusion Matrix")
print(f"Confusion matrix:\n{disp.confusion_matrix}")
plt.show()
