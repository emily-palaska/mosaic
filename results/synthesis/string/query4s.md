CONTEXT:   Compare cross decomposition methods  Simple usage of various cross decomposition algorithms:  - PLSCanonical - PLSRegression, with
multivariate response, a.k.a. PLS2 - PLSRegression, with univariate response, a.k.a. PLS1 - CCA  Given 2 multivariate covarying two-dimensional
datasets, X, and Y, PLS extracts the 'directions of covariance', i.e. the components of each datasets that explain the most shared variance between
both datasets. This is apparent on the **scatterplot matrix** display: components 1 in dataset X and dataset Y are maximally correlated (points lie
around the first diagonal). This is also true for components 2 in both dataset, however, the correlation across datasets for different components is
weak: the point cloud is very spherical.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause
