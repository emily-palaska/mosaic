CONTEXT: With just a few iterations, HGBT models can achieve convergence (see
`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`), meaning that adding more trees does not improve the model anymore. In
the figure above, 5 iterations are not enough to get good predictions. With 50 iterations, we are already able to do a good job.  Setting `max_iter`
too high might degrade the prediction quality and cost a lot of avoidable computing resources. Therefore, the HGBT implementation in scikit-learn
provides an automatic **early stopping** strategy. With it, the model uses a fraction of the training data as internal validation set
(`validation_fraction`) and stops training if the validation score does not improve (or degrades) after `n_iter_no_change` iterations up to a certain
tolerance (`tol`).  Notice that there is a trade-off between `learning_rate` and `max_iter`: Generally, smaller learning rates are preferable but
require more iterations to converge to the minimum loss, while larger learning rates converge faster (less iterations/trees needed) but at the cost of
a larger minimum loss.  Because of this high correlation between the learning rate the number of iterations, a good practice is to tune the learning
rate along with all (important) other hyperparameters, fit the HBGT on the training set with a large enough value for `max_iter` and determine the
best `max_iter` via early stopping and some explicit `validation_fraction`.   COMMENT:
