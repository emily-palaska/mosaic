## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Estimate the covariance   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_sparse_coding.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Sparse coding with a precomputed dictionary  Transform a signal as a sparse combination of Ricker wavelets. This example visually compares
different sparse coding methods using the :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.SparseCoder` estimator. The Ricker (also known as Mexican hat or the second
derivative of a Gaussian) is not a particularly good kernel to represent piecewise constant signals like this one. It can therefore be seen how much
adding different widths of atoms matters and it therefore motivates learning the dictionary to best fit your type of signals.  The richer dictionary
on the right is not larger in size, heavier subsampling is performed in order to stay on the same order of magnitude.  COMMENT:
```python
def ricker_matrix(width, resolution, n_components):    """Dictionary of Ricker (Mexican hat) wavelets"""    centers = np.linspace(0, resolution - 1, n_components)    D = np.empty((n_components, resolution))    for i, center in enumerate(centers):        D[i] = ricker_function(resolution, center, width)    D /= np.sqrt(np.sum(D**2, axis=1))[:, np.newaxis]    return D
```
