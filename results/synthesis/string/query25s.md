## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_feature_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate sample data    COMMENT: Some noisy data not correlated
```python
X = np.hstack((X, E))
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_optics.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Demo of OPTICS clustering algorithm  .. currentmodule:: sklearn  Finds core samples of high density and expands clusters from them. This
example uses data that is generated so that the clusters have different densities.  The :class:`~cluster.OPTICS` is first used with its Xi cluster
detection method, and then setting specific thresholds on the reachability, which corresponds to :class:`~cluster.DBSCAN`. We can see that the
different clusters of OPTICS's Xi method can be recovered with different choices of thresholds in DBSCAN.  COMMENT: DBSCAN at 0.5
```python
color = ["g.", "r.", "b.", "c."]
for klass, color in enumerate(color):
    Xk = X[labels_050 == klass]
    ax3.plot(Xk[:, 0], Xk[:, 1], color, alpha=0.3)
ax3.plot(X[labels_050 == -1, 0], X[labels_050 == -1, 1], "k+", alpha=0.1)
ax3.set_title("Clustering at 0.5 epsilon cut\nDBSCAN")
```

## Code Concatenation
```python
X = np.hstack((X, E))
color = ["g.", "r.", "b.", "c."]
for klass, color in enumerate(color):
    Xk = X[labels_050 == klass]
    ax3.plot(Xk[:, 0], Xk[:, 1], color, alpha=0.3)
ax3.plot(X[labels_050 == -1, 0], X[labels_050 == -1, 1], "k+", alpha=0.1)
ax3.set_title("Clustering at 0.5 epsilon cut\nDBSCAN")
```
