CONTEXT:   Feature importances with a forest of trees  This example shows the use of a forest of trees to evaluate the importance of features on an
artificial classification task. The blue bars are the feature importances of the forest, along with their inter-trees variability represented by the
error bars.  As expected, the plot suggests that 3 features are informative, while the remaining are not.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn

CONTEXT:  Data: 2D projection of the iris dataset   COMMENT: we only take the first two features for visualization
```python
X = iris.data[:, 0:2]
```

## Code Concatenation

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
X = iris.data[:, 0:2]
