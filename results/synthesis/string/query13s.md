## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_feature_selection_pipeline.ipynb
CONTEXT: We will start by generating a binary classification dataset. Subsequently, we will divide the dataset into two subsets.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=3)
clf = LinearSVC()
anova_svm = make_pipeline(anova_filter, clf)
anova_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_feature_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Univariate feature selection  Univariate feature selection with F-test for feature scoring. We use the default selection function to select
the four most significant features.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
clf = make_pipeline(MinMaxScaler(), LinearSVC())
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(
    "Classification accuracy without selecting features: {:.3f}".format(
        clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    )
)
svm_weights = np.abs(clf[-1].coef_).sum(axis=0)
svm_weights /= svm_weights.sum()
```

## Code Concatenation

from sklearn.feature_selection import SelectKBest, f_classif
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
anova_filter = SelectKBest(f_classif, k=3)
clf = LinearSVC()
anova_svm = make_pipeline(anova_filter, clf)
anova_svm.fit(X_train, y_train)
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import MinMaxScaler
from sklearn.svm import LinearSVC
clf = make_pipeline(MinMaxScaler(), LinearSVC())
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
print(
    "Classification accuracy without selecting features: {:.3f}".format(
        clf.score(X_test, y_test)
    )
)
svm_weights = np.abs(clf[-1].coef_).sum(axis=0)
svm_weights /= svm_weights.sum()
