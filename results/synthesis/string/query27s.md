## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Recognizing hand-written digits  This example shows how scikit-learn can be used to recognize images of hand-written digits, from 0-9.
COMMENT: Import datasets, classifiers and performance metrics
```python
from sklearn import datasets, metrics, svm
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_sparse_coding.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Sparse coding with a precomputed dictionary  Transform a signal as a sparse combination of Ricker wavelets. This example visually compares
different sparse coding methods using the :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.SparseCoder` estimator. The Ricker (also known as Mexican hat or the second
derivative of a Gaussian) is not a particularly good kernel to represent piecewise constant signals like this one. It can therefore be seen how much
adding different widths of atoms matters and it therefore motivates learning the dictionary to best fit your type of signals.  The richer dictionary
on the right is not larger in size, heavier subsampling is performed in order to stay on the same order of magnitude.  COMMENT: Soft thresholding
debiasing
```python
    SparseCoder = SparseCoder(
        dictionary=D, transform_algorithm="threshold", transform_alpha=20
    )
    x = SparseCoder.transform(y.reshape(1, -1))
    _, idx = (x != 0).nonzero()
    x[0, idx], _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(D[idx, :].T, y, rcond=None)
    x = np.ravel(np.dot(x, D))
    squared_error = np.sum((y - x) ** 2)
    plt.plot(
        x,
        color="darkorange",
        lw=lw,
        label="Thresholding w/ debiasing:\n%d nonzero coefs, %.2f error"
        % (len(idx), squared_error),
    )
    plt.axis("tight")
    plt.legend(shadow=False, loc="best")
plt.subplots_adjust(0.04, 0.07, 0.97, 0.90, 0.09, 0.2)
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_rfe_digits.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Recursive feature elimination  This example demonstrates how Recursive Feature Elimination (:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.RFE`) can be
used to determine the importance of individual pixels for classifying handwritten digits. :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.RFE` recursively removes
the least significant features, assigning ranks based on their importance, where higher `ranking_` values denote lower importance. The ranking is
visualized using both shades of blue and pixel annotations for clarity. As expected, pixels positioned at the center of the image tend to be more
predictive than those near the edges.  <div class="alert alert-info"><h4>Note</h4><p>See also

```python
plt.matshow(ranking, cmap=plt.cm.Blues)

    SparseCoder = SparseCoder(
        dictionary=D, transform_algorithm="threshold", transform_alpha=20
    )
    x = SparseCoder.transform(y.reshape(1, -1))
    _, idx = (x != 0).nonzero()
    x[0, idx], _, _, _ = np.linalg.lstsq(D[idx, :].T, y, rcond=None)
    x = np.ravel(np.dot(x, D))
    squared_error = np.sum((y - x) ** 2)

        x,
