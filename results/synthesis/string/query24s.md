## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_categorical.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Gradient boosting estimator with native categorical support We now create a :class:`~ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` estimator that
will natively handle categorical features. This estimator will not treat categorical features as ordered quantities. We set
`categorical_features="from_dtype"` such that features with categorical dtype are considered categorical features.  The main difference between this
estimator and the previous one is that in this one, we let the :class:`~ensemble.HistGradientBoostingRegressor` detect which features are categorical
from the DataFrame columns' dtypes.   COMMENT:
```python
hist_native = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(
    random_state=42, categorical_features="from_dtype"
)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_bisect_kmeans.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Bisecting K-Means and Regular K-Means Performance Comparison  This example shows differences between Regular K-Means algorithm and
Bisecting K-Means.  While K-Means clusterings are different when increasing n_clusters, Bisecting K-Means clustering builds on top of the previous
ones. As a result, it tends to create clusters that have a more regular large-scale structure. This difference can be visually observed: for all
numbers of clusters, there is a dividing line cutting the overall data cloud in two for BisectingKMeans, which is not present for regular K-Means.
COMMENT: Algorithms to compare
```python
clustering_algorithms = {
    "Bisecting K-Means": BisectingKMeans,
    "K-Means": KMeans,
}
