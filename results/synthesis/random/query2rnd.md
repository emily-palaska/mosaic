### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Plot feature importance  <div class="alert alert-danger"><h4>Warning</h4><p>Careful, impurity-based feature importances can be misleading
for    **high cardinality** features (many unique values). As an alternative,    the permutation importances of ``reg`` can be computed on a    held
out test set. See `permutation_importance` for more details.</p></div>  For this example, the impurity-based and permutation methods identify the same
2 strongly predictive features but not in the same order. The third most predictive feature, "bp", is also the same for the 2 methods. The remaining
features are less predictive and the error bars of the permutation plot show that they overlap with 0.   COMMENT: `labels` argument in boxplot is
deprecated in matplotlib 3.9 and has been renamed to `tick_labels`. The following code handles this, but as a scikit-learn user you probably can write
simpler code by using `labels=...` (matplotlib < 3.9) or `tick_labels=...` (matplotlib >= 3.9).
```python
tick_labels_parameter_name = (
    "tick_labels"
    if parse_version(matplotlib.__version__) >= parse_version("3.9")
    else "labels"
)
tick_labels_dict = {
    tick_labels_parameter_name: np.array(diabetes.feature_names)[sorted_idx]
}
plt.boxplot(result.importances[sorted_idx].T, vert=False, **tick_labels_dict)
plt.title("Permutation Importance (test set)")
fig.tight_layout()
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT:  The data  We start by creating a simple dataset with two features. Before we even dive into PCR and PLS, we fit a PCA estimator to display
the two principal components of this dataset, i.e. the two directions that explain the most variance in the data.   COMMENT: scale component by its
variance explanation power
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import pca
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
n_samples = 500
cov = [[3, 3], [3, 4]]
X = rng.multivariate_normal(mean=[0, 0], cov=cov, size=n_samples)
pca = pca(n_components=2).fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], alpha=0.3, label="samples")
for i, (comp, var) in enumerate(zip(pca.components_, pca.explained_variance_)):
    comp = comp * var

    plt.plot(
        [0, comp[0]],
        [0, comp[1]],
        label=f"Component {i}",
        linewidth=5,
        color=f"C{i + 2}",
    )
plt.gca().set(
    aspect="equal",
    title="2-dimensional dataset with principal components",
    xlabel="first feature",
    ylabel="second feature",
)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_hgbt_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT: Observe that `nswdemand` and `vicdemand` seem already monotonic without constraint. This is a good example to show that the model with
monotonicity constraints is "overconstraining".  Additionally, we can verify that the predictive quality of the model is not significantly degraded by
introducing the monotonic constraints. For such purpose we use :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit` cross-validation to estimate the
variance of the test score. By doing so we guarantee that the training data does not succeed the testing data, which is crucial when dealing with data
that have a temporal relationship.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, root_mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit, cross_validate
TimeSeriesSplit = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5, gap=48, test_size=336)

scorer = make_scorer(root_mean_squared_error)
cv_results = cross_validate(hgbt_cst, X, y, cv=TimeSeriesSplit, scoring=scorer)
root_mean_squared_error = cv_results["test_score"]
print(f"RMSE without constraints = {root_mean_squared_error.mean():.3f} +/- {root_mean_squared_error.std():.3f}")
cv_results = cross_validate(hgbt_cst, X, y, cv=TimeSeriesSplit, scoring=scorer)
root_mean_squared_error = cv_results["test_score"]
print(f"RMSE with constraints    = {root_mean_squared_error.mean():.3f} +/- {root_mean_squared_error.std():.3f}")
```

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_mahalanobis_distances.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate data  First, we generate a dataset of 125 samples and 2 features. Both features are Gaussian distributed with mean of 0 but feature
1 has a standard deviation equal to 2 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 1. Next, 25 samples are replaced with Gaussian outlier samples
where feature 1 has a standard deviation equal to 1 and feature 2 has a standard deviation equal to 7.   COMMENT:
```python
np.random.seed(7)
n_samples = 125
n_outliers = 25
n_features = 2
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_digits_classification.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Classification  To apply a classifier on this data, we need to flatten the images, turning each 2-D array of grayscale values from shape
``(8, 8)`` into shape ``(64,)``. Subsequently, the entire dataset will be of shape ``(n_samples, n_features)``, where ``n_samples`` is the number of
images and ``n_features`` is the total number of pixels in each image.  We can then split the data into train and test subsets and fit a support
vector classifier on the train samples. The fitted classifier can subsequently be used to predict the value of the digit for the samples in the test
subset.   COMMENT: Learn the digits on the train subset
```python
clf.fit(X_train, y_train)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_ica_blind_source_separation.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate sample data   COMMENT: Signal 3: saw tooth signal
```python
s3 = signal.sawtooth(2 * np.pi * time)
