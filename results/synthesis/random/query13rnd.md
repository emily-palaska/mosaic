### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate the data   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.covariance import GraphicalLassoCV, ledoit_wolf
emp_cov = np.dot(X.T, X) / n_samples
model = GraphicalLassoCV()
model.fit(X)
cov_ = model.covariance_
prec_ = model.precision_
lw_cov_, _ = ledoit_wolf(X)
lw_prec_ = linalg.inv(lw_cov_)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_calibration_curve.ipynb
CONTEXT: Notice that although calibration improves the `brier_score_loss` (a metric composed of calibration term and refinement term) and `log_loss`,
it does not significantly alter the prediction accuracy measures (precision, recall and F1 score). This is because calibration should not
significantly change prediction probabilities at the location of the decision threshold (at x = 0.5 on the graph). Calibration should however, make
the predicted probabilities more accurate and thus more useful for making allocation decisions under uncertainty. Further, ROC AUC, should not change
at all because calibration is a monotonic transformation. Indeed, no rank metrics are affected by calibration.   Linear support vector classifier
Next, we will compare:  * :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` (baseline) * Uncalibrated :class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC`. Since SVC does
not output   probabilities by default, we naively scale the output of the   :term:`decision_function` into [0, 1] by applying min-max scaling. *
:class:`~sklearn.svm.LinearSVC` with isotonic and sigmoid   calibration (see `User Guide <calibration>`)   COMMENT:

def fit(self, X, y):        super().fit(X, y)        df = self.decision_function(X)        self.df_min_ = df.min()        self.df_max_ = df.max()

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_regularization.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Gradient Boosting regularization  Illustration of the effect of different regularization strategies for Gradient Boosting. The example is
taken from Hastie et al 2009 [1]_.  The loss function used is binomial deviance. Regularization via shrinkage (``learning_rate < 1.0``) improves
performance considerably. In combination with shrinkage, stochastic gradient boosting (``subsample < 1.0``) can produce more accurate models by
reducing the variance via bagging. Subsampling without shrinkage usually does poorly. Another strategy to reduce the variance is by subsampling the
features analogous to the random splits in Random Forests (via the ``max_features`` parameter).  .. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman,
"Elements of Statistical     Learning Ed. 2", Springer, 2009.  COMMENT: compute test set deviance
```python
    test_deviance = np.zeros((params["n_estimators"],), dtype=np.float64)
    for i, y_proba in enumerate(clf.staged_predict_proba(X_test)):
        test_deviance[i] = 2 * log_loss(y_test, y_proba[:, 1])
    plt.plot(
        (np.arange(test_deviance.shape[0]) + 1)[::5],
        test_deviance[::5],

        label=label,
    )

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_varimax_fa.ipynb
CONTEXT: Load Iris data   COMMENT:
```python
data = load_iris()
X = StandardScaler().fit_transform(data["data"])
feature_names = data["feature_names"]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_hgbt_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT: With just a few iterations, HGBT models can achieve convergence (see
`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`), meaning that adding more trees does not improve the model anymore. In
the figure above, 5 iterations are not enough to get good predictions. With 50 iterations, we are already able to do a good job.  Setting `max_iter`
too high might degrade the prediction quality and cost a lot of avoidable computing resources. Therefore, the HGBT implementation in scikit-learn
provides an automatic **early stopping** strategy. With it, the model uses a fraction of the training data as internal validation set
(`validation_fraction`) and stops training if the validation score does not improve (or degrades) after `n_iter_no_change` iterations up to a certain
tolerance (`tol`).  Notice that there is a trade-off between `learning_rate` and `max_iter`: Generally, smaller learning rates are preferable but
require more iterations to converge to the minimum loss, while larger learning rates converge faster (less iterations/trees needed) but at the cost of
a larger minimum loss.  Because of this high correlation between the learning rate the number of iterations, a good practice is to tune the learning
rate along with all (important) other hyperparameters, fit the HBGT on the training set with a large enough value for `max_iter` and determine the
best `max_iter` via early stopping and some explicit `validation_fraction`.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/biclustering/plot_spectral_biclustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fitting `SpectralBiclustering` We fit the model and compare the obtained clusters with the ground truth. Note that when creating the model
we specify the same number of clusters that we used to create the dataset (`n_clusters = (4, 3)`), which will contribute to obtain a good result.

score = consensus_score(
    model.biclusters_, (rows[:, row_idx_shuffled], columns[:, row_idx_shuffled])
)
