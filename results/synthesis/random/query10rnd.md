### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_covariance_estimation.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Shrinkage covariance estimation: LedoitWolf vs OAS and max-likelihood  When working with covariance estimation, the usual approach is to
use a maximum likelihood estimator, such as the :class:`~sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance`. It is unbiased, i.e. it converges to the true
(population) covariance when given many observations. However, it can also be beneficial to regularize it, in order to reduce its variance; this, in
turn, introduces some bias. This example illustrates the simple regularization used in `shrunk_covariance` estimators. In particular, it focuses on
how to set the amount of regularization, i.e. how to choose the bias-variance trade-off.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_categorical.ipynb
CONTEXT: We see that the model with one-hot-encoded data is by far the slowest. This is to be expected, since one-hot-encoding creates one additional
feature per category value (for each categorical feature), and thus more split points need to be considered during fitting. In theory, we expect the
native handling of categorical features to be slightly slower than treating categories as ordered quantities ('Ordinal'), since native handling
requires `sorting categories <categorical_support_gbdt>`. Fitting times should however be close when the number of categories is small, and this may
not always be reflected in practice.  In terms of prediction performance, dropping the categorical features leads to poorer performance. The three
models that use categorical features have comparable error rates, with a slight edge for the native handling.   Limiting the number of splits In
general, one can expect poorer predictions from one-hot-encoded data, especially when the tree depths or the number of nodes are limited: with one-
hot-encoded data, one needs more split points, i.e. more depth, in order to recover an equivalent split that could be obtained in one single split
point with native handling.  This is also true when categories are treated as ordinal quantities: if categories are `A..F` and the best split is `ACF
- BDE` the one-hot-encoder model will need 3 split points (one per category in the left node), and the ordinal non-native model will need 4 splits: 1
split to isolate `A`, 1 split to isolate `F`, and 2 splits to isolate `C` from `BCDE`.  How strongly the models' performances differ in practice will
depend on the dataset and on the flexibility of the trees.  To see this, let us re-run the same analysis with under-fitting models where we
artificially limit the total number of splits by both limiting the number of trees and the depth of each tree.   COMMENT:

)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_robust_vs_empirical_covariance.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Robust vs Empirical covariance estimate  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate is very sensitive to the presence of outliers in
the data set. In such a case, it would be better to use a robust estimator of covariance to guarantee that the estimation is resistant to "erroneous"
observations in the data set. [1]_, [2]_   Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator is a robust, high-
breakdown point (i.e. it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of highly contaminated datasets, up to $\frac{n_\text{samples} -
n_\text{features}-1}{2}$ outliers) estimator of covariance. The idea is to find $\frac{n_\text{samples} + n_\text{features}+1}{2}$ observations whose
empirical covariance has the smallest determinant, yielding a "pure" subset of observations from which to compute standards estimates of location and
covariance. After a correction step aiming at compensating the fact that the estimates were learned from only a portion of the initial data, we end up
with robust estimates of the data set location and covariance.  The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator (MCD) has been introduced by P.J.Rousseuw
in [3]_.   Evaluation In this example, we compare the estimation errors that are made when using various types of location and covariance estimates on
contaminated Gaussian distributed data sets:  - The mean and the empirical covariance of the full dataset, which break   down as soon as there are
outliers in the data set - The robust MCD, that has a low error provided   $n_\text{samples} > 5n_\text{features}$ - The mean and the empirical
covariance of the observations that are known   to be good ones. This can be considered as a "perfect" MCD estimation,   so one can trust our
implementation by comparing to this case.    References .. [1] Johanna Hardin, David M Rocke. The distribution of robust distances.     Journal of

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_hdbscan.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate sample data One of the greatest advantages of HDBSCAN over DBSCAN is its out-of-the-box robustness. It's especially remarkable on
heterogeneous mixtures of data. Like DBSCAN, it can model arbitrary shapes and distributions, however unlike DBSCAN it does not require specification
of an arbitrary and sensitive `eps` hyperparameter.  For example, below we generate a dataset from a mixture of three bi-dimensional and isotropic
Gaussian distributions.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_face_compress.ipynb
CONTEXT: Qualitatively, we can spot some small regions where we see the effect of the compression (e.g. leaves on the bottom right corner). But after
all, the resulting image is still looking good.  We observe that the distribution of pixels values have been mapped to 8 different values. We can
check the correspondence between such values and the original pixel values.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_random_forest_regression_multioutput.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Comparing random forests and the multi-output meta estimator  An example to compare multi-output regression with random forest and the
`multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor <multiclass>` meta-estimator.  This example illustrates the use of the `multioutput.MultiOutputRegressor
<multiclass>` meta-estimator to perform multi-output regression. A random forest regressor is used, which supports multi-output regression natively,
so the results can be compared.  The random forest regressor will only ever predict values within the range of observations or closer to zero for each
of the targets. As a result the predictions are biased towards the centre of the circle.  Using a single underlying feature the model learns both the
x and y coordinate as output.  COMMENT: Predict on new data

y_test = regr_multirf.predict(X_test)

coef_agglomeration_ = coef_.reshape(size, size)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.ipynb
CONTEXT: One column shows all models evaluated by the same metric. The minimum number on a column should be obtained when the model is trained and
measured with the same metric. This should be always the case on the training set if the training converged.  Note that because the target
distribution is asymmetric, the expected conditional mean and conditional median are significantly different and therefore one could not use the
squared error model get a good estimation of the conditional median nor the converse.  If the target distribution were symmetric and had no outliers
(e.g. with a Gaussian noise), then median estimator and the least squares estimator would have yielded similar predictions.  We then do the same on
the test set.   COMMENT:
```python
results = []
for name, y_pred in sorted(all_models.items()):
    metrics = {"model": name}
    y_pred = y_pred.predict(X_test)
