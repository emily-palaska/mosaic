## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_hgbt_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT: Observe that `nswdemand` and `vicdemand` seem already monotonic without constraint. This is a good example to show that the model with
monotonicity constraints is "overconstraining".  Additionally, we can verify that the predictive quality of the model is not significantly degraded by
introducing the monotonic constraints. For such purpose we use :class:`~sklearn.model_selection.TimeSeriesSplit` cross-validation to estimate the
variance of the test score. By doing so we guarantee that the training data does not succeed the testing data, which is crucial when dealing with data
that have a temporal relationship.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.metrics import make_scorer, root_mean_squared_error
from sklearn.model_selection import TimeSeriesSplit, cross_validate
TimeSeriesSplit = TimeSeriesSplit(n_splits=5, gap=48, test_size=336)

scorer = make_scorer(root_mean_squared_error)
cv_results = cross_validate(hgbt_cst, X, y, cv=TimeSeriesSplit, scoring=scorer)
root_mean_squared_error = cv_results["test_score"]
print(f"RMSE without constraints = {root_mean_squared_error.mean():.3f} +/- {root_mean_squared_error.std():.3f}")

CONTEXT: Set parameters   COMMENT: image size
```python
size = 40
```

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_feature_selection_pipeline.ipynb
CONTEXT: Be aware that you can inspect a step in the pipeline. For instance, we might be interested about the parameters of the classifier. Since we
selected three features, we expect to have three coefficients.   COMMENT:
```python
anova_svm[:-1].inverse_transform(anova_svm[-1].coef_)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT: For the purpose of this example, we now define the target `y` such that it is strongly correlated with a direction that has a small variance.
To this end, we will project `X` onto the second component, and add some noise to it.   COMMENT:
```python
pca = pcr.named_steps["pca"]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decision_trees/plot_tree_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fit regression model Here we fit two models with different maximum depths   COMMENT:
```python
X_test = np.arange(0.0, 5.0, 0.01)[:, np.newaxis]
y_1 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
y_2 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
