### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Principal Component Regression vs Partial Least Squares Regression  This example compares [Principal Component
Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principal_component_regression) (PCR) and [Partial Least Squares
Regression](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partial_least_squares_regression) (PLS) on a toy dataset. Our goal is to illustrate how PLS can outperform
PCR when the target is strongly correlated with some directions in the data that have a low variance.  PCR is a regressor composed of two steps:
first, :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA` is applied to the training data, possibly performing dimensionality reduction; then, a regressor (e.g. a
linear regressor) is trained on the transformed samples. In :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.PCA`, the transformation is purely unsupervised, meaning
that no information about the targets is used. As a result, PCR may perform poorly in some datasets where the target is strongly correlated with
*directions* that have low variance. Indeed, the dimensionality reduction of PCA projects the data into a lower dimensional space where the variance
of the projected data is greedily maximized along each axis. Despite them having the most predictive power on the target, the directions with a lower
variance will be dropped, and the final regressor will not be able to leverage them.  PLS is both a transformer and a regressor, and it is quite
similar to PCR: it also applies a dimensionality reduction to the samples before applying a linear regressor to the transformed data. The main
difference with PCR is that the PLS transformation is supervised. Therefore, as we will see in this example, it does not suffer from the issue we just
mentioned.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_random_forest_embedding.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Hashing feature transformation using Totally Random Trees  RandomTreesEmbedding provides a way to map data to a very high-dimensional,
sparse representation, which might be beneficial for classification. The mapping is completely unsupervised and very efficient.  This example
visualizes the partitions given by several trees and shows how the transformation can also be used for non-linear dimensionality reduction or non-
linear classification.  Points that are neighboring often share the same leaf of a tree and therefore share large parts of their hashed
representation. This allows to separate two concentric circles simply based on the principal components of the transformed data with truncated SVD.
In high-dimensional spaces, linear classifiers often achieve excellent accuracy. For sparse binary data, BernoulliNB is particularly well-suited. The
bottom row compares the decision boundary obtained by BernoulliNB in the transformed space with an ExtraTreesClassifier forests learned on the
original data.  COMMENT: Visualize result after dimensionality reduction using truncated SVD

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_rfe_digits.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Recursive feature elimination  This example demonstrates how Recursive Feature Elimination (:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.RFE`) can be
used to determine the importance of individual pixels for classifying handwritten digits. :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.RFE` recursively removes
the least significant features, assigning ranks based on their importance, where higher `ranking_` values denote lower importance. The ranking is
visualized using both shades of blue and pixel annotations for clarity. As expected, pixels positioned at the center of the image tend to be more
predictive than those near the edges.  <div class="alert alert-info"><h4>Note</h4><p>See also

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_hgbt_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT: With just a few iterations, HGBT models can achieve convergence (see
`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`), meaning that adding more trees does not improve the model anymore. In
the figure above, 5 iterations are not enough to get good predictions. With 50 iterations, we are already able to do a good job.  Setting `max_iter`
too high might degrade the prediction quality and cost a lot of avoidable computing resources. Therefore, the HGBT implementation in scikit-learn
provides an automatic **early stopping** strategy. With it, the model uses a fraction of the training data as internal validation set
(`validation_fraction`) and stops training if the validation score does not improve (or degrades) after `n_iter_no_change` iterations up to a certain
tolerance (`tol`).  Notice that there is a trade-off between `learning_rate` and `max_iter`: Generally, smaller learning rates are preferable but
require more iterations to converge to the minimum loss, while larger learning rates converge faster (less iterations/trees needed) but at the cost of
a larger minimum loss.  Because of this high correlation between the learning rate the number of iterations, a good practice is to tune the learning
rate along with all (important) other hyperparameters, fit the HBGT on the training set with a large enough value for `max_iter` and determine the
best `max_iter` via early stopping and some explicit `validation_fraction`.   COMMENT:
