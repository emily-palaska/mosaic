## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_select_from_model_diabetes.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Loading the data  We first load the diabetes dataset which is available from within scikit-learn, and print its description:   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import RidgeCV
ridge = RidgeCV(alphas=np.logspace(-6, 6, num=5)).fit(X, y)
importance = np.abs(ridge.coef_)
feature_names = np.array(diabetes.feature_names)
plt.bar(height=importance, x=feature_names)
plt.title("Feature importances via coefficients")
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.ipynb
CONTEXT: Each data point on each scatter plot refers to one of the 150 iris flowers in the dataset, with the color indicating their respective type
(Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica).  You can already see a pattern regarding the Setosa type, which is easily identifiable based on its short and
wide sepal. Only considering these two dimensions, sepal width and length, there's still overlap between the Versicolor and Virginica types.  The
diagonal of the plot shows the distribution of each feature. We observe that the petal width and the petal length are the most discriminant features
for the three types.   Plot a PCA representation Let's apply a Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to the iris dataset and then plot the irises across
the first three PCA dimensions. This will allow us to better differentiate among the three types!   COMMENT: unused but required import for doing 3d
projections with matplotlib < 3.2
```python
import mpl_toolkits.mplot3d

from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
fig = plt.figure(1, figsize=(8, 6))
ax = fig.add_subplot(111, projection="3d", elev=-150, azim=110)
X_reduced = PCA(n_components=3).fit_transform(iris.data)
scatter = ax.scatter(
    X_reduced[:, 0],
    X_reduced[:, 1],
    X_reduced[:, 2],
    c=iris.target,
    s=40,
)
ax.set(
    title="First three PCA dimensions",
    xlabel="1st Eigenvector",
    ylabel="2nd Eigenvector",
    zlabel="3rd Eigenvector",
)
ax.xaxis.set_ticklabels([])
ax.yaxis.set_ticklabels([])
ax.zaxis.set_ticklabels([])
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_stack_predictors.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Download the dataset  We will use the `Ames Housing`_ dataset which was first compiled by Dean De Cock and became better known after it was
used in Kaggle challenge. It is a set of 1460 residential homes in Ames, Iowa, each described by 80 features. We will use it to predict the final
logarithmic price of the houses. In this example we will use only 20 most interesting features chosen using GradientBoostingRegressor() and limit
number of entries (here we won't go into the details on how to select the most interesting features).  The Ames housing dataset is not shipped with
scikit-learn and therefore we will fetch it from `OpenML`_.    COMMENT:
```python
X, y = load_ames_housing()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_linkage_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT: Generate datasets. We choose the size big enough to see the scalability of the algorithms, but not too big to avoid too long running times
COMMENT: blobs with varied variances
```python
varied = datasets.make_blobs(
    n_samples=n_samples, cluster_std=[1.0, 2.5, 0.5], random_state=170
)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Gaussian Naive-Bayes   COMMENT: With no calibration
```python
clf_isotonic = CalibratedClassifierCV(clf, cv=2, method="isotonic")
clf_isotonic.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=sw_train)
prob_pos_isotonic = clf_isotonic.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Create a graph capturing local connectivity. Larger number of neighbors will give more homogeneous
clusters to the cost of computation time. A very large number of neighbors gives more evenly distributed cluster sizes, but may not impose the local
manifold structure of the data

kneighbors_graph = kneighbors_graph(X, 30, include_self=False)

                linkage=linkage, connectivity=connectivity, n_clusters=n_clusters
            )
            t0 = time.time()
            model.fit(X)
            elapsed_time = time.time() - t0
            plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=model.labels_, cmap=plt.cm.nipy_spectral)
