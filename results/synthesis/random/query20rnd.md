### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Estimate the covariance   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_feature_agglomeration_vs_univariate_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT: Set parameters   COMMENT: image size
```python
size = 40
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_sparse_coding.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Sparse coding with a precomputed dictionary  Transform a signal as a sparse combination of Ricker wavelets. This example visually compares
different sparse coding methods using the :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.SparseCoder` estimator. The Ricker (also known as Mexican hat or the second
derivative of a Gaussian) is not a particularly good kernel to represent piecewise constant signals like this one. It can therefore be seen how much
adding different widths of atoms matters and it therefore motivates learning the dictionary to best fit your type of signals.  The richer dictionary
on the right is not larger in size, heavier subsampling is performed in order to stay on the same order of magnitude.  COMMENT:
```python
size = 1024
subsampling = 3

width = 100
n_components = size // subsampling
```

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_lw_vs_oas.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Ledoit-Wolf vs OAS estimation  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate can be regularized using shrinkage. Ledoit and Wolf
proposed a close formula to compute the asymptotically optimal shrinkage parameter (minimizing a MSE criterion), yielding the Ledoit-Wolf covariance
estimate.  Chen et al. proposed an improvement of the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage parameter, the OAS coefficient, whose convergence is significantly better
under the assumption that the data are Gaussian.  This example, inspired from Chen's publication [1], shows a comparison of the estimated MSE of the
LW and OAS methods, using Gaussian distributed data.  [1] "Shrinkage Algorithms for MMSE Covariance Estimation" Chen et al., IEEE Trans. on Sign.

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_ensemble_oob.ipynb
CONTEXT:   OOB Errors for Random Forests  The ``RandomForestClassifier`` is trained using *bootstrap aggregation*, where each new tree is fit from a
bootstrap sample of the training observations $z_i = (x_i, y_i)$. The *out-of-bag* (OOB) error is the average error for each $z_i$ calculated using
predictions from the trees that do not contain $z_i$ in their respective bootstrap sample. This allows the ``RandomForestClassifier`` to be fit and
validated whilst being trained [1]_.  The example below demonstrates how the OOB error can be measured at the addition of each new tree during
training. The resulting plot allows a practitioner to approximate a suitable value of ``n_estimators`` at which the error stabilizes.  .. [1] T.
