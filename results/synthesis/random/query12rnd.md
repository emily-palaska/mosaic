### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb

```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_incremental_pca.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Incremental PCA  Incremental principal component analysis (IPCA) is typically used as a replacement for principal component analysis (PCA)
when the dataset to be decomposed is too large to fit in memory. IPCA builds a low-rank approximation for the input data using an amount of memory
which is independent of the number of input data samples. It is still dependent on the input data features, but changing the batch size allows for
control of memory usage.  This example serves as a visual check that IPCA is able to find a similar projection of the data to PCA (to a sign flip),
while only processing a few samples at a time. This can be considered a "toy example", as IPCA is intended for large datasets which do not fit in main
memory, requiring incremental approaches.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fitting non-linear quantile and least squares regressors  Fit gradient boosting models trained with the quantile loss and alpha=0.05, 0.5,
0.95.  The models obtained for alpha=0.05 and alpha=0.95 produce a 90% confidence interval (95% - 5% = 90%).  The model trained with alpha=0.5
produces a regression of the median: on average, there should be the same number of target observations above and below the predicted values.
