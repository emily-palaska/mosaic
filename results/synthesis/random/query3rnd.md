### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_regularization.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Gradient Boosting regularization  Illustration of the effect of different regularization strategies for Gradient Boosting. The example is
taken from Hastie et al 2009 [1]_.  The loss function used is binomial deviance. Regularization via shrinkage (``learning_rate < 1.0``) improves
performance considerably. In combination with shrinkage, stochastic gradient boosting (``subsample < 1.0``) can produce more accurate models by
reducing the variance via bagging. Subsampling without shrinkage usually does poorly. Another strategy to reduce the variance is by subsampling the
features analogous to the random splits in Random Forests (via the ``max_features`` parameter).  .. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman,

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_stack_predictors.ipynb
CONTEXT: Then, we will need to design preprocessing pipelines which depends on the ending regressor. If the ending regressor is a linear model, one
needs to one-hot encode the categories. If the ending regressor is a tree-based model an ordinal encoder will be sufficient. Besides, numerical values
need to be standardized for a linear model while the raw numerical data can be treated as is by a tree-based model. However, both models need an
imputer to handle missing values.  We will first design the pipeline required for the tree-based models.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Calibration curves  Below, we train each of the four models with the small training dataset, then plot calibration curves (also known as
reliability diagrams) using predicted probabilities of the test dataset. Calibration curves are created by binning predicted probabilities, then
plotting the mean predicted probability in each bin against the observed frequency ('fraction of positives'). Below the calibration curve, we plot a
histogram showing the distribution of the predicted probabilities or more specifically, the number of samples in each predicted probability bin.

def fit(self, X, y):        super().fit(X, y)        df = self.decision_function(X)        self.df_min_ = df.min()        self.df_max_ = df.max()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Generate sample data

t = 1.5 * np.pi * (1 + 3 * np.random.rand(1, n_samples))
x = t * np.cos(t)
