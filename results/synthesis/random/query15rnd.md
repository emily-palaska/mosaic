### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Probability calibration of classifiers  When performing classification you often want to predict not only the class label, but also the
associated probability. This probability gives you some kind of confidence on the prediction. However, not all classifiers provide well-calibrated
probabilities, some being over-confident while others being under-confident. Thus, a separate calibration of predicted probabilities is often
desirable as a postprocessing. This example illustrates two different methods for this calibration and evaluates the quality of the returned
probabilities using Brier's score (see https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brier_score).  Compared are the estimated probability using a Gaussian naive
Bayes classifier without calibration, with a sigmoid calibration, and with a non-parametric isotonic calibration. One can observe that only the non-
parametric model is able to provide a probability calibration that returns probabilities close to the expected 0.5 for most of the samples belonging
to the middle cluster with heterogeneous labels. This results in a significantly improved Brier score.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT:  The data  We start by creating a simple dataset with two features. Before we even dive into PCR and PLS, we fit a PCA estimator to display
the two principal components of this dataset, i.e. the two directions that explain the most variance in the data.   COMMENT: scale component by its
variance explanation power

import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import decomposition
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
n_samples = 500
cov = [[3, 3], [3, 4]]
X = rng.multivariate_normal(mean=[0, 0], cov=cov, size=n_samples)
decomposition = decomposition(n_components=2).fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], alpha=0.3, label="samples")
for i, (comp, var) in enumerate(zip(decomposition.components_, decomposition.explained_variance_)):

```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_hdbscan.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate sample data One of the greatest advantages of HDBSCAN over DBSCAN is its out-of-the-box robustness. It's especially remarkable on
heterogeneous mixtures of data. Like DBSCAN, it can model arbitrary shapes and distributions, however unlike DBSCAN it does not require specification
of an arbitrary and sensitive `eps` hyperparameter.  For example, below we generate a dataset from a mixture of three bi-dimensional and isotropic
Gaussian distributions.   COMMENT:
```python
centers = [[1, 1], [-1, -1], [1.5, -1.5]]
X, labels_true = make_blobs(
    n_samples=750, centers=centers, cluster_std=[0.4, 0.1, 0.75], random_state=0
)

### notebooks/dataset2/decision_trees/plot_tree_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fit regression model Here we fit two models with different maximum depths   COMMENT:

y_1 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
y_2 = regr_1.predict(X_test)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_voting_regressor.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Making predictions  Now we will use each of the regressors to make the 20 first predictions.   COMMENT:
