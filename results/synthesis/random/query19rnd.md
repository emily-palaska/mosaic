## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Estimate the covariance   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_pca_iris.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Loading the Iris dataset  The Iris dataset is directly available as part of scikit-learn. It can be loaded using the
:func:`~sklearn.datasets.load_iris` function. With the default parameters, a :class:`~sklearn.utils.Bunch` object is returned, containing the data,
the target values, the feature names, and the target names.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
iris = load_iris(as_frame=True)
print(iris.keys())
```

### notebooks/dataset2/biclustering/plot_bicluster_newsgroups.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Biclustering documents with the Spectral Co-clustering algorithm  This example demonstrates the Spectral Co-clustering algorithm on the
twenty newsgroups dataset. The 'comp.os.ms-windows.misc' category is excluded because it contains many posts containing nothing but data.  The TF-IDF
vectorized posts form a word frequency matrix, which is then biclustered using Dhillon's Spectral Co-Clustering algorithm. The resulting document-word
biclusters indicate subsets words used more often in those subsets documents.  For a few of the best biclusters, its most common document categories
and its ten most important words get printed. The best biclusters are determined by their normalized cut. The best words are determined by comparing
their sums inside and outside the bicluster.  For comparison, the documents are also clustered using MiniBatchKMeans. The document clusters derived
from the biclusters achieve a better V-measure than clusters found by MiniBatchKMeans.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_lw_vs_oas.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Ledoit-Wolf vs OAS estimation  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate can be regularized using shrinkage. Ledoit and Wolf
proposed a close formula to compute the asymptotically optimal shrinkage parameter (minimizing a MSE criterion), yielding the Ledoit-Wolf covariance
estimate.  Chen et al. proposed an improvement of the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage parameter, the OAS coefficient, whose convergence is significantly better
under the assumption that the data are Gaussian.  This example, inspired from Chen's publication [1], shows a comparison of the estimated MSE of the
LW and OAS methods, using Gaussian distributed data.  [1] "Shrinkage Algorithms for MMSE Covariance Estimation" Chen et al., IEEE Trans. on Sign.
