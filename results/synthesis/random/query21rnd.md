## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_stack_predictors.ipynb
CONTEXT: Then, we will need to design preprocessing pipelines which depends on the ending regressor. If the ending regressor is a linear model, one
needs to one-hot encode the categories. If the ending regressor is a tree-based model an ordinal encoder will be sufficient. Besides, numerical values
need to be standardized for a linear model while the raw numerical data can be treated as is by a tree-based model. However, both models need an
imputer to handle missing values.  We will first design the pipeline required for the tree-based models.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.compose import make_column_transformer
from sklearn.impute import SimpleImputer
from sklearn.pipeline import make_pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import OrdinalEncoder
cat_tree_processor = OrdinalEncoder(
    handle_unknown="use_encoded_value",
    unknown_value=-1,
    encoded_missing_value=-2,
)
num_tree_processor = SimpleImputer(strategy="mean", add_indicator=True)
tree_preprocessor = make_column_transformer(
    (num_tree_processor, num_selector), (cat_tree_processor, cat_selector)
)
tree_preprocessor
```

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_feature_selection_pipeline.ipynb
CONTEXT: Be aware that you can inspect a step in the pipeline. For instance, we might be interested about the parameters of the classifier. Since we
selected three features, we expect to have three coefficients.   COMMENT:
```python
anova_svm[:-1].inverse_transform(anova_svm[-1].coef_)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_hgbt_regression.ipynb
CONTEXT: With just a few iterations, HGBT models can achieve convergence (see
`sphx_glr_auto_examples_ensemble_plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.py`), meaning that adding more trees does not improve the model anymore. In
the figure above, 5 iterations are not enough to get good predictions. With 50 iterations, we are already able to do a good job.  Setting `max_iter`
too high might degrade the prediction quality and cost a lot of avoidable computing resources. Therefore, the HGBT implementation in scikit-learn
provides an automatic **early stopping** strategy. With it, the model uses a fraction of the training data as internal validation set
(`validation_fraction`) and stops training if the validation score does not improve (or degrades) after `n_iter_no_change` iterations up to a certain
tolerance (`tol`).  Notice that there is a trade-off between `learning_rate` and `max_iter`: Generally, smaller learning rates are preferable but
require more iterations to converge to the minimum loss, while larger learning rates converge faster (less iterations/trees needed) but at the cost of
a larger minimum loss.  Because of this high correlation between the learning rate the number of iterations, a good practice is to tune the learning
rate along with all (important) other hyperparameters, fit the HBGT on the training set with a large enough value for `max_iter` and determine the
best `max_iter` via early stopping and some explicit `validation_fraction`.   COMMENT:
```python
common_params = {
    "max_iter": 1_000,
    "learning_rate": 0.3,
    "validation_fraction": 0.2,
    "random_state": 42,
    "categorical_features": None,
    "scoring": "neg_root_mean_squared_error",
}
hgbt = HistGradientBoostingRegressor(early_stopping=True, **common_params)
hgbt.fit(X_train, y_train)
_, ax = plt.subplots()
plt.plot(-hgbt.validation_score_)
_ = ax.set(
    xlabel="number of iterations",
    ylabel="root mean squared error",
    title=f"Loss of hgbt with early stopping (n_iter={hgbt.n_iter_})",
)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/biclustering/plot_spectral_biclustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fitting `SpectralBiclustering` We fit the model and compare the obtained clusters with the ground truth. Note that when creating the model
we specify the same number of clusters that we used to create the dataset (`n_clusters = (4, 3)`), which will contribute to obtain a good result.
COMMENT: Compute the similarity of two sets of biclusters
```python
reordered_rows = data[np.argsort(model.row_labels_)]
reordered_data = reordered_rows[:, np.argsort(model.column_labels_)]
plt.matshow(reordered_data, cmap=plt.cm.Blues)
plt.title("After biclustering; rearranged to show biclusters")
_ = plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_hdbscan.ipynb
CONTEXT: While standardizing data (e.g. using :class:`sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler`) helps mitigate this problem, great care must be taken to
select the appropriate value for `eps`.  HDBSCAN is much more robust in this sense: HDBSCAN can be seen as clustering over all possible values of
`eps` and extracting the best clusters from all possible clusters (see `User Guide <HDBSCAN>`). One immediate advantage is that HDBSCAN is scale-
invariant.   COMMENT:
```python
fig, axes = plt.subplots(3, 1, figsize=(10, 12))
hdb = HDBSCAN()
for idx, scale in enumerate([1, 0.5, 3]):
    hdb.fit(X * scale)
    plot(
        X * scale,
        hdb.labels_,
        hdb.probabilities_,
        ax=axes[idx],
        parameters={"scale": scale},
    )
```

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Gaussian Naive-Bayes   COMMENT: With no calibration
```python
clf_isotonic = CalibratedClassifierCV(clf, cv=2, method="isotonic")
clf_isotonic.fit(X_train, y_train, sample_weight=sw_train)
prob_pos_isotonic = clf_isotonic.predict_proba(X_test)[:, 1]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_faces_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT: Similar to the previous examples, we change parameters and train :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning` estimator on all
images. Generally, the dictionary learning and sparse encoding decompose input data into the dictionary and the coding coefficients matrices. $X
\approx UV$, where $X = [x_1, . . . , x_n]$, $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m×n}$, dictionary $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m×k}$, coding coefficients $V \in
\mathbb{R}^{k×n}$.  Also below are the results when the dictionary and coding coefficients are positively constrained.   Dictionary learning -
positive dictionary  In the following section we enforce positivity when finding the dictionary.   COMMENT:
```python
dict_pos_dict_estimator = decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning(
    n_components=n_components,
    alpha=0.1,
    max_iter=50,
    batch_size=3,
    random_state=rng,
    positive_dict=True,
)
dict_pos_dict_estimator.fit(faces_centered)
plot_gallery(
    "Dictionary learning - positive dictionary",
    dict_pos_dict_estimator.components_[:n_components],
    cmap=plt.cm.RdBu,
)
