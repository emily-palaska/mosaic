deprecated in matplotlib 3.9 and has been renamed to `tick_labels`. The following code handles this, but as a scikit-learn user you probably can write
simpler code by using `labels=...` (matplotlib < 3.9) or `tick_labels=...` (matplotlib >= 3.9).

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_bias_variance.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Single estimator versus bagging: bias-variance decomposition  This example illustrates and compares the bias-variance decomposition of the
expected mean squared error of a single estimator against a bagging ensemble.  In regression, the expected mean squared error of an estimator can be
decomposed in terms of bias, variance and noise. On average over datasets of the regression problem, the bias term measures the average amount by
which the predictions of the estimator differ from the predictions of the best possible estimator for the problem (i.e., the Bayes model). The
variance term measures the variability of the predictions of the estimator when fit over different random instances of the same problem. Each problem
instance is noted "LS", for "Learning Sample", in the following. Finally, the noise measures the irreducible part of the error which is due the
variability in the data.  The upper left figure illustrates the predictions (in dark red) of a single decision tree trained over a random dataset LS
(the blue dots) of a toy 1d regression problem. It also illustrates the predictions (in light red) of other single decision trees trained over other
(and different) randomly drawn instances LS of the problem. Intuitively, the variance term here corresponds to the width of the beam of predictions
(in light red) of the individual estimators. The larger the variance, the more sensitive are the predictions for `x` to small changes in the training
set. The bias term corresponds to the difference between the average prediction of the estimator (in cyan) and the best possible model (in dark blue).
On this problem, we can thus observe that the bias is quite low (both the cyan and the blue curves are close to each other) while the variance is
large (the red beam is rather wide).  The lower left figure plots the pointwise decomposition of the expected mean squared error of a single decision
tree. It confirms that the bias term (in blue) is low while the variance is large (in green). It also illustrates the noise part of the error which,
as expected, appears to be constant and around `0.01`.  The right figures correspond to the same plots but using instead a bagging ensemble of
decision trees. In both figures, we can observe that the bias term is larger than in the previous case. In the upper right figure, the difference
between the average prediction (in cyan) and the best possible model is larger (e.g., notice the offset around `x=2`). In the lower right figure, the
bias curve is also slightly higher than in the lower left figure. In terms of variance however, the beam of predictions is narrower, which suggests
that the variance is lower. Indeed, as the lower right figure confirms, the variance term (in green) is lower than for single decision trees. Overall,
the bias-variance decomposition is therefore no longer the same. The tradeoff is better for bagging: averaging several decision trees fit on bootstrap
copies of the dataset slightly increases the bias term but allows for a larger reduction of the variance, which results in a lower overall mean
squared error (compare the red curves int the lower figures). The script output also confirms this intuition. The total error of the bagging ensemble
is lower than the total error of a single decision tree, and this difference indeed mainly stems from a reduced variance.  For further details on
bias-variance decomposition, see section 7.3 of [1]_.   References  .. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman,        "Elements of Statistical

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_forest_hist_grad_boosting_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT: HGBT uses a histogram-based algorithm on binned feature values that can efficiently handle large datasets (tens of thousands of samples or
more) with a high number of features (see `Why_it's_faster`). The scikit-learn implementation of RF does not use binning and relies on exact
splitting, which can be computationally expensive.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Create a graph capturing local connectivity. Larger number of neighbors will give more homogeneous
clusters to the cost of computation time. A very large number of neighbors gives more evenly distributed cluster sizes, but may not impose the local
manifold structure of the data

kneighbors_graph = kneighbors_graph(X, 30, include_self=False)
