## Synthesis Blocks
### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_sparse_cov.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Estimate the covariance   COMMENT:
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.subplots_adjust(left=0.02, right=0.98)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_feature_transformation.ipynb
CONTEXT: For each of the ensemble methods, we will use 10 estimators and a maximum depth of 3 levels.   COMMENT:
```python
n_estimators = 10
max_depth = 3
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_feature_agglomeration_vs_univariate_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT: Set parameters   COMMENT: image size
```python
size = 40
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_image_denoising.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate distorted image   COMMENT: Scipy >= 1.10
```python
try:
```

### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT: For the purpose of this example, we now define the target `y` such that it is strongly correlated with a direction that has a small variance.
To this end, we will project `X` onto the second component, and add some noise to it.   COMMENT:
```python
pca = pcr.named_steps["pca"]
```

### notebooks/dataset2/decomposition/plot_faces_decomposition.ipynb
CONTEXT: Similar to the previous examples, we change parameters and train :class:`~sklearn.decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning` estimator on all
images. Generally, the dictionary learning and sparse encoding decompose input data into the dictionary and the coding coefficients matrices. $X
\approx UV$, where $X = [x_1, . . . , x_n]$, $X \in \mathbb{R}^{m×n}$, dictionary $U \in \mathbb{R}^{m×k}$, coding coefficients $V \in
\mathbb{R}^{k×n}$.  Also below are the results when the dictionary and coding coefficients are positively constrained.   Dictionary learning -
positive dictionary  In the following section we enforce positivity when finding the dictionary.   COMMENT:
```python
dict_pos_dict_estimator = decomposition.MiniBatchDictionaryLearning(
    n_components=n_components,
    alpha=0.1,
    max_iter=50,
    batch_size=3,
    random_state=rng,
    positive_dict=True,
)
dict_pos_dict_estimator.fit(faces_centered)
plot_gallery(
    "Dictionary learning - positive dictionary",
    dict_pos_dict_estimator.components_[:n_components],
    cmap=plt.cm.RdBu,
)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Create a graph capturing local connectivity. Larger number of neighbors will give more homogeneous
clusters to the cost of computation time. A very large number of neighbors gives more evenly distributed cluster sizes, but may not impose the local
manifold structure of the data
```python
kneighbors_graph = kneighbors_graph(X, 30, include_self=False)
for connectivity in (None, kneighbors_graph):
    for n_clusters in (30, 3):
        plt.figure(figsize=(10, 4))
        for index, linkage in enumerate(("average", "complete", "ward", "single")):
            plt.subplot(1, 4, index + 1)
            model = AgglomerativeClustering(
                linkage=linkage, connectivity=connectivity, n_clusters=n_clusters
            )
            t0 = time.time()
            model.fit(X)
            elapsed_time = time.time() - t0
            plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=model.labels_, cmap=plt.cm.nipy_spectral)
            plt.title(
                "linkage=%s\n(time %.2fs)" % (linkage, elapsed_time),
                fontdict=dict(verticalalignment="top"),
            )
            plt.axis("equal")
            plt.axis("off")
            plt.subplots_adjust(bottom=0, top=0.83, wspace=0, left=0, right=1)
            plt.suptitle(
                "n_cluster=%i, connectivity=%r"
                % (n_clusters, connectivity is not None),
                size=17,
            )
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/classification/plot_classifier_comparison.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Classifier comparison  A comparison of several classifiers in scikit-learn on synthetic datasets. The point of this example is to
illustrate the nature of decision boundaries of different classifiers. This should be taken with a grain of salt, as the intuition conveyed by these
examples does not necessarily carry over to real datasets.  Particularly in high-dimensional spaces, data can more easily be separated linearly and
the simplicity of classifiers such as naive Bayes and linear SVMs might lead to better generalization than is achieved by other classifiers.  The
plots show training points in solid colors and testing points semi-transparent. The lower right shows the classification accuracy on the test set.
COMMENT: Plot the testing points
```python
ax.scatter(
    X_test[:, 0], X_test[:, 1], c=y_test, cmap=cm_bright, alpha=0.6, edgecolors="k"
)
ax.set_xlim(x_min, x_max)
ax.set_ylim(y_max, y_max)
