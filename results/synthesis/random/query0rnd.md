### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_select_from_model_diabetes.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Model-based and sequential feature selection  This example illustrates and compares two approaches for feature selection:
:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` which is based on feature importance, and
:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SequentialFeatureSelector` which relies on a greedy approach.  We use the Diabetes dataset, which consists of 10
features collected from 442 diabetes patients.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_oob.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Gradient Boosting Out-of-Bag estimates Out-of-bag (OOB) estimates can be a useful heuristic to estimate the "optimal" number of boosting
iterations. OOB estimates are almost identical to cross-validation estimates but they can be computed on-the-fly without the need for repeated model
fitting. OOB estimates are only available for Stochastic Gradient Boosting (i.e. ``subsample < 1.0``), the estimates are derived from the improvement
in loss based on the examples not included in the bootstrap sample (the so-called out-of-bag examples). The OOB estimator is a pessimistic estimator
of the true test loss, but remains a fairly good approximation for a small number of trees. The figure shows the cumulative sum of the negative OOB
improvements as a function of the boosting iteration. As you can see, it tracks the test loss for the first hundred iterations but then diverges in a
pessimistic way. The figure also shows the performance of 3-fold cross validation which usually gives a better estimate of the test loss but is
computationally more demanding.  COMMENT:
```python
def cv_estimate(n_splits=None):    cv = KFold(n_splits=n_splits)    cv_clf = ensemble.GradientBoostingClassifier(**params)    val_scores = np.zeros((n_estimators,), dtype=np.float64)    for train, test in cv.split(X_train, y_train):        cv_clf.fit(X_train[train], y_train[train])        val_scores += heldout_score(cv_clf, X_train[test], y_train[test])    val_scores /= n_splits    return val_scores
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_forest_iris.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Plot the decision surfaces of ensembles of trees on the iris dataset  Plot the decision surfaces of forests of randomized trees trained on
pairs of features of the iris dataset.  This plot compares the decision surfaces learned by a decision tree classifier (first column), by a random
forest classifier (second column), by an extra-trees classifier (third column) and by an AdaBoost classifier (fourth column).  In the first row, the
classifiers are built using the sepal width and the sepal length features only, on the second row using the petal length and sepal length only, and on
the third row using the petal width and the petal length only.  In descending order of quality, when trained (outside of this example) on all 4
features using 30 estimators and scored using 10 fold cross validation, we see::      ExtraTreesClassifier()   0.95 score     RandomForestClassifier()
0.94 score     AdaBoost(DecisionTree(max_depth=3))   0.94 score     DecisionTree(max_depth=None)   0.94 score  Increasing `max_depth` for AdaBoost
lowers the standard deviation of the scores (but the average score does not improve).  See the console's output for further details about each model.
In this example you might try to:  1) vary the ``max_depth`` for the ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` and    ``AdaBoostClassifier``, perhaps try
``max_depth=3`` for the    ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` or ``max_depth=None`` for ``AdaBoostClassifier`` 2) vary ``n_estimators``  It is worth noting
that RandomForests and ExtraTrees can be fitted in parallel on many cores as each tree is built independently of the others. AdaBoost's samples are
built sequentially and so do not use multiple cores.  COMMENT: We only take the two corresponding features

    for model in models:
        X_test = iris.data[:, pair]
        y = iris.target

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_adaboost_multiclass.ipynb
CONTEXT: The plot shows the missclassification error on the test set after each boosting iteration. We see that the error of the boosted trees
converges to an error of around 0.3 after 50 iterations, indicating a significantly higher accuracy compared to a single tree, as illustrated by the
dashed line in the plot.  The misclassification error jitters because the `SAMME` algorithm uses the discrete outputs of the weak learners to train
the boosted model.  The convergence of :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier` is mainly influenced by the learning rate (i.e. `learning_rate`),
the number of weak learners used (`n_estimators`), and the expressivity of the weak learners (e.g. `max_leaf_nodes`).   Errors and weights of the Weak
Learners As previously mentioned, AdaBoost is a forward stagewise additive model. We now focus on understanding the relationship between the
attributed weights of the weak learners and their statistical performance.  We use the fitted :class:`~sklearn.ensemble.AdaBoostClassifier`'s
attributes `estimator_errors_` and `estimator_weights_` to investigate this link.   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_robust_vs_empirical_covariance.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Robust vs Empirical covariance estimate  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate is very sensitive to the presence of outliers in
the data set. In such a case, it would be better to use a robust estimator of covariance to guarantee that the estimation is resistant to "erroneous"
observations in the data set. [1]_, [2]_   Minimum Covariance Determinant Estimator The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator is a robust, high-
breakdown point (i.e. it can be used to estimate the covariance matrix of highly contaminated datasets, up to $\frac{n_\text{samples} -
n_\text{features}-1}{2}$ outliers) estimator of covariance. The idea is to find $\frac{n_\text{samples} + n_\text{features}+1}{2}$ observations whose
empirical covariance has the smallest determinant, yielding a "pure" subset of observations from which to compute standards estimates of location and
covariance. After a correction step aiming at compensating the fact that the estimates were learned from only a portion of the initial data, we end up
with robust estimates of the data set location and covariance.  The Minimum Covariance Determinant estimator (MCD) has been introduced by P.J.Rousseuw
in [3]_.   Evaluation In this example, we compare the estimation errors that are made when using various types of location and covariance estimates on
contaminated Gaussian distributed data sets:  - The mean and the empirical covariance of the full dataset, which break   down as soon as there are
outliers in the data set - The robust MCD, that has a low error provided   $n_\text{samples} > 5n_\text{features}$ - The mean and the empirical
covariance of the observations that are known   to be good ones. This can be considered as a "perfect" MCD estimation,   so one can trust our
implementation by comparing to this case.    References .. [1] Johanna Hardin, David M Rocke. The distribution of robust distances.     Journal of

CONTEXT:  Calibration curves   Gaussian Naive Bayes  First, we will compare:  * :class:`~sklearn.linear_model.LogisticRegression` (used as baseline

fraction of positive classes in each bin on the y-axis.   COMMENT:
