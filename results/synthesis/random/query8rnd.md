### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_lw_vs_oas.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Ledoit-Wolf vs OAS estimation  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate can be regularized using shrinkage. Ledoit and Wolf
proposed a close formula to compute the asymptotically optimal shrinkage parameter (minimizing a MSE criterion), yielding the Ledoit-Wolf covariance
estimate.  Chen et al. proposed an improvement of the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage parameter, the OAS coefficient, whose convergence is significantly better
under the assumption that the data are Gaussian.  This example, inspired from Chen's publication [1], shows a comparison of the estimated MSE of the
LW and OAS methods, using Gaussian distributed data.  [1] "Shrinkage Algorithms for MMSE Covariance Estimation" Chen et al., IEEE Trans. on Sign.

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Generate sample data
```python
n_samples = 1500
np.random.seed(0)
t = 1.5 * np.pi * (1 + 3 * np.random.rand(1, n_samples))
x = t * np.cos(t)
y = t * np.sin(t)
X = np.concatenate((x, y))
X += 0.7 * np.random.randn(2, n_samples)
X = X.T
```

```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_dendrogram.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Plot Hierarchical Clustering Dendrogram This example plots the corresponding dendrogram of a hierarchical clustering using
AgglomerativeClustering and the dendrogram method available in scipy.  COMMENT: plot the top three levels of the dendrogram
```python
plot_dendrogram(model, truncate_mode="level", p=3)
plt.xlabel("Number of points in node (or index of point if no parenthesis).")
plt.show()
```

nmf_estimator.fit(faces)

plot_gallery("Non-negative components - NMF", nmf_estimator.components_[:n_components])
