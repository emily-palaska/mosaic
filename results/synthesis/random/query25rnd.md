### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Fitting non-linear quantile and least squares regressors  Fit gradient boosting models trained with the quantile loss and alpha=0.05, 0.5,
0.95.  The models obtained for alpha=0.05 and alpha=0.95 produce a 90% confidence interval (95% - 5% = 90%).  The model trained with alpha=0.5
produces a regression of the median: on average, there should be the same number of target observations above and below the predicted values.

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Comparison of Calibration of Classifiers  Well calibrated classifiers are probabilistic classifiers for which the output of
:term:`predict_proba` can be directly interpreted as a confidence level. For instance, a well calibrated (binary) classifier should classify the
samples such that for the samples to which it gave a :term:`predict_proba` value close to 0.8, approximately 80% actually belong to the positive
class.  In this example we will compare the calibration of four different models: `Logistic_regression`, `gaussian_naive_bayes`, `Random Forest
Classifier <forest>` and `Linear SVM <svm_classification>`. Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_hdbscan.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Generate sample data One of the greatest advantages of HDBSCAN over DBSCAN is its out-of-the-box robustness. It's especially remarkable on
heterogeneous mixtures of data. Like DBSCAN, it can model arbitrary shapes and distributions, however unlike DBSCAN it does not require specification
of an arbitrary and sensitive `eps` hyperparameter.  For example, below we generate a dataset from a mixture of three bi-dimensional and isotropic
Gaussian distributions.   COMMENT:

centers = [[1, 1], [-1, -1], [1.5, -1.5]]

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_regularization.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Gradient Boosting regularization  Illustration of the effect of different regularization strategies for Gradient Boosting. The example is
taken from Hastie et al 2009 [1]_.  The loss function used is binomial deviance. Regularization via shrinkage (``learning_rate < 1.0``) improves
performance considerably. In combination with shrinkage, stochastic gradient boosting (``subsample < 1.0``) can produce more accurate models by
reducing the variance via bagging. Subsampling without shrinkage usually does poorly. Another strategy to reduce the variance is by subsampling the
features analogous to the random splits in Random Forests (via the ``max_features`` parameter).  .. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman,

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Create a graph capturing local connectivity. Larger number of neighbors will give more homogeneous
clusters to the cost of computation time. A very large number of neighbors gives more evenly distributed cluster sizes, but may not impose the local
manifold structure of the data

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_lw_vs_oas.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Ledoit-Wolf vs OAS estimation  The usual covariance maximum likelihood estimate can be regularized using shrinkage. Ledoit and Wolf
proposed a close formula to compute the asymptotically optimal shrinkage parameter (minimizing a MSE criterion), yielding the Ledoit-Wolf covariance
estimate.  Chen et al. proposed an improvement of the Ledoit-Wolf shrinkage parameter, the OAS coefficient, whose convergence is significantly better
under the assumption that the data are Gaussian.  This example, inspired from Chen's publication [1], shows a comparison of the estimated MSE of the
LW and OAS methods, using Gaussian distributed data.  [1] "Shrinkage Algorithms for MMSE Covariance Estimation" Chen et al., IEEE Trans. on Sign.
