### notebooks/dataset2/cross_decomposition/plot_pcr_vs_pls.ipynb
CONTEXT:  The data  We start by creating a simple dataset with two features. Before we even dive into PCR and PLS, we fit a PCA estimator to display
the two principal components of this dataset, i.e. the two directions that explain the most variance in the data.   COMMENT: scale component by its
variance explanation power
```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import numpy as np
from sklearn.decomposition import pca
rng = np.random.RandomState(0)
train_samples = 500
cov = [[3, 3], [3, 4]]
X = rng.multivariate_normal(mean=[0, 0], cov=cov, size=train_samples)
pca = pca(n_components=2).fit(X)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], alpha=0.3, label="samples")
for i, (comp, var) in enumerate(zip(pca.components_, pca.explained_variance_)):
    comp = comp * var

    plt.plot(
        [0, comp[0]],
        [0, comp[1]],
        label=f"Component {i}",
        linewidth=5,
        color=f"C{i + 2}",

    aspect="equal",

plt.legend()
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_covariance_estimation.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Shrinkage covariance estimation: LedoitWolf vs OAS and max-likelihood  When working with covariance estimation, the usual approach is to
use a maximum likelihood estimator, such as the :class:`~sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance`. It is unbiased, i.e. it converges to the true
(population) covariance when given many observations. However, it can also be beneficial to regularize it, in order to reduce its variance; this, in
turn, introduces some bias. This example illustrates the simple regularization used in `shrunk_covariance` estimators. In particular, it focuses on
how to set the amount of regularization, i.e. how to choose the bias-variance trade-off.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Comparison of Calibration of Classifiers  Well calibrated classifiers are probabilistic classifiers for which the output of
:term:`predict_proba` can be directly interpreted as a confidence level. For instance, a well calibrated (binary) classifier should classify the
samples such that for the samples to which it gave a :term:`predict_proba` value close to 0.8, approximately 80% actually belong to the positive
class.  In this example we will compare the calibration of four different models: `Logistic_regression`, `gaussian_naive_bayes`, `Random Forest
Classifier <forest>` and `Linear SVM <svm_classification>`. Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_rfe_digits.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Recursive feature elimination  This example demonstrates how Recursive Feature Elimination (:class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.RFE`) can be
used to determine the importance of individual pixels for classifying handwritten digits. :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.RFE` recursively removes
the least significant features, assigning ranks based on their importance, where higher `ranking_` values denote lower importance. The ranking is
visualized using both shades of blue and pixel annotations for clarity. As expected, pixels positioned at the center of the image tend to be more
predictive than those near the edges.  <div class="alert alert-info"><h4>Note</h4><p>See also

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_feature_agglomeration_vs_univariate_selection.ipynb
CONTEXT: Anova univariate feature selection followed by BayesianRidge   COMMENT: Select the optimal percentage of features with grid search
```python
clf = GridSearchCV(clf, {"anova__percentile": [5, 10, 20]}, cv=cv)
clf.fit(X, y)

coef_ = clf.best_estimator_.steps[-1][1].coef_
coef_ = clf.best_estimator_.steps[0][1].inverse_transform(coef_.reshape(1, -1))
