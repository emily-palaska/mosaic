### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_covariance_estimation.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Shrinkage covariance estimation: LedoitWolf vs OAS and max-likelihood  When working with covariance estimation, the usual approach is to
use a maximum likelihood estimator, such as the :class:`~sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance`. It is unbiased, i.e. it converges to the true
(population) covariance when given many observations. However, it can also be beneficial to regularize it, in order to reduce its variance; this, in
turn, introduces some bias. This example illustrates the simple regularization used in `shrunk_covariance` estimators. In particular, it focuses on
how to set the amount of regularization, i.e. how to choose the bias-variance trade-off.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-

### notebooks/dataset2/calibration/plot_compare_calibration.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Comparison of Calibration of Classifiers  Well calibrated classifiers are probabilistic classifiers for which the output of
:term:`predict_proba` can be directly interpreted as a confidence level. For instance, a well calibrated (binary) classifier should classify the
samples such that for the samples to which it gave a :term:`predict_proba` value close to 0.8, approximately 80% actually belong to the positive
class.  In this example we will compare the calibration of four different models: `Logistic_regression`, `gaussian_naive_bayes`, `Random Forest
Classifier <forest>` and `Linear SVM <svm_classification>`. Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-Identifier: BSD-3-Clause   COMMENT:

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_bias_variance.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Single estimator versus bagging: bias-variance decomposition  This example illustrates and compares the bias-variance decomposition of the
expected mean squared error of a single estimator against a bagging ensemble.  In regression, the expected mean squared error of an estimator can be
decomposed in terms of bias, variance and noise. On average over datasets of the regression problem, the bias term measures the average amount by
which the predictions of the estimator differ from the predictions of the best possible estimator for the problem (i.e., the Bayes model). The
variance term measures the variability of the predictions of the estimator when fit over different random instances of the same problem. Each problem
instance is noted "LS", for "Learning Sample", in the following. Finally, the noise measures the irreducible part of the error which is due the
variability in the data.  The upper left figure illustrates the predictions (in dark red) of a single decision tree trained over a random dataset LS
(the blue dots) of a toy 1d regression problem. It also illustrates the predictions (in light red) of other single decision trees trained over other
(and different) randomly drawn instances LS of the problem. Intuitively, the variance term here corresponds to the width of the beam of predictions
(in light red) of the individual estimators. The larger the variance, the more sensitive are the predictions for `x` to small changes in the training
set. The bias term corresponds to the difference between the average prediction of the estimator (in cyan) and the best possible model (in dark blue).
On this problem, we can thus observe that the bias is quite low (both the cyan and the blue curves are close to each other) while the variance is
large (the red beam is rather wide).  The lower left figure plots the pointwise decomposition of the expected mean squared error of a single decision
tree. It confirms that the bias term (in blue) is low while the variance is large (in green). It also illustrates the noise part of the error which,
as expected, appears to be constant and around `0.01`.  The right figures correspond to the same plots but using instead a bagging ensemble of
decision trees. In both figures, we can observe that the bias term is larger than in the previous case. In the upper right figure, the difference
between the average prediction (in cyan) and the best possible model is larger (e.g., notice the offset around `x=2`). In the lower right figure, the
bias curve is also slightly higher than in the lower left figure. In terms of variance however, the beam of predictions is narrower, which suggests
that the variance is lower. Indeed, as the lower right figure confirms, the variance term (in green) is lower than for single decision trees. Overall,
the bias-variance decomposition is therefore no longer the same. The tradeoff is better for bagging: averaging several decision trees fit on bootstrap
copies of the dataset slightly increases the bias term but allows for a larger reduction of the variance, which results in a lower overall mean
squared error (compare the red curves int the lower figures). The script output also confirms this intuition. The total error of the bagging ensemble
is lower than the total error of a single decision tree, and this difference indeed mainly stems from a reduced variance.  For further details on
bias-variance decomposition, see section 7.3 of [1]_.   References  .. [1] T. Hastie, R. Tibshirani and J. Friedman,        "Elements of Statistical

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_oob.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Gradient Boosting Out-of-Bag estimates Out-of-bag (OOB) estimates can be a useful heuristic to estimate the "optimal" number of boosting
iterations. OOB estimates are almost identical to cross-validation estimates but they can be computed on-the-fly without the need for repeated model
fitting. OOB estimates are only available for Stochastic Gradient Boosting (i.e. ``subsample < 1.0``), the estimates are derived from the improvement
in loss based on the examples not included in the bootstrap sample (the so-called out-of-bag examples). The OOB estimator is a pessimistic estimator
of the true test loss, but remains a fairly good approximation for a small number of trees. The figure shows the cumulative sum of the negative OOB
improvements as a function of the boosting iteration. As you can see, it tracks the test loss for the first hundred iterations but then diverges in a
pessimistic way. The figure also shows the performance of 3-fold cross validation which usually gives a better estimate of the test loss but is
computationally more demanding.  COMMENT: Compute best n_estimator for test data
