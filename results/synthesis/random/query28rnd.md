### notebooks/dataset2/covariance_estimation/plot_covariance_estimation.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Shrinkage covariance estimation: LedoitWolf vs OAS and max-likelihood  When working with covariance estimation, the usual approach is to
use a maximum likelihood estimator, such as the :class:`~sklearn.covariance.EmpiricalCovariance`. It is unbiased, i.e. it converges to the true
(population) covariance when given many observations. However, it can also be beneficial to regularize it, in order to reduce its variance; this, in
turn, introduces some bias. This example illustrates the simple regularization used in `shrunk_covariance` estimators. In particular, it focuses on
how to set the amount of regularization, i.e. how to choose the bias-variance trade-off.  COMMENT: Authors: The scikit-learn developers SPDX-License-

### notebooks/dataset2/feature_selection/plot_select_from_model_diabetes.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Selecting features based on importance  Now we want to select the two features which are the most important according to the coefficients.
The :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` is meant just for that. :class:`~sklearn.feature_selection.SelectFromModel` accepts a
`threshold` parameter and will select the features whose importance (defined by the coefficients) are above this threshold.  Since we want to select
only 2 features, we will set this threshold slightly above the coefficient of third most important feature.   COMMENT:
```python
from sklearn.feature_selection import SequentialFeatureSelector
tic_bwd = time()
sfs_forward = SequentialFeatureSelector(
    ridge, n_features_to_select=2, direction="forward"
).fit(X, y)
tic_bwd = time()
tic_bwd = time()
sfs_backward = SequentialFeatureSelector(
    ridge, n_features_to_select=2, direction="backward"
).fit(X, y)
toc_bwd = time()
print(
    "Features selected by forward sequential selection: "
    f"{base_X_train[sfs_forward.get_support()]}"
)
print(f"Done in {tic_bwd - tic_bwd:.3f}s")
print(
    "Features selected by backward sequential selection: "
    f"{base_X_train[sfs_backward.get_support()]}"
)
print(f"Done in {toc_bwd - tic_bwd:.3f}s")
```

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_forest_iris.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Plot the decision surfaces of ensembles of trees on the iris dataset  Plot the decision surfaces of forests of randomized trees trained on
pairs of features of the iris dataset.  This plot compares the decision surfaces learned by a decision tree classifier (first column), by a random
forest classifier (second column), by an extra-trees classifier (third column) and by an AdaBoost classifier (fourth column).  In the first row, the
classifiers are built using the sepal width and the sepal length features only, on the second row using the petal length and sepal length only, and on
the third row using the petal width and the petal length only.  In descending order of quality, when trained (outside of this example) on all 4
features using 30 estimators and scored using 10 fold cross validation, we see::      ExtraTreesClassifier()   0.95 score     RandomForestClassifier()
0.94 score     AdaBoost(DecisionTree(max_depth=3))   0.94 score     DecisionTree(max_depth=None)   0.94 score  Increasing `max_depth` for AdaBoost
lowers the standard deviation of the scores (but the average score does not improve).  See the console's output for further details about each model.
In this example you might try to:  1) vary the ``max_depth`` for the ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` and    ``AdaBoostClassifier``, perhaps try
``max_depth=3`` for the    ``DecisionTreeClassifier`` or ``max_depth=None`` for ``AdaBoostClassifier`` 2) vary ``n_estimators``  It is worth noting
that RandomForests and ExtraTrees can be fitted in parallel on many cores as each tree is built independently of the others. AdaBoost's samples are
built sequentially and so do not use multiple cores.  COMMENT: fix the seed on each iteration
```python
RANDOM_SEED = 13

### notebooks/dataset2/ensemble_methods/plot_gradient_boosting_quantile.ipynb
CONTEXT: Errors are higher meaning the models slightly overfitted the data. It still shows that the best test metric is obtained when the model is
trained by minimizing this same metric.  Note that the conditional median estimator is competitive with the squared error estimator in terms of MSE on
the test set: this can be explained by the fact the squared error estimator is very sensitive to large outliers which can cause significant
overfitting. This can be seen on the right hand side of the previous plot. The conditional median estimator is biased (underestimation for this
asymmetric noise) but is also naturally robust to outliers and overfits less.    Calibration of the confidence interval  We can also evaluate the
ability of the two extreme quantile estimators at producing a well-calibrated conditional 90%-confidence interval.  To do this we can compute the
fraction of observations that fall between the predictions:   COMMENT:
```python
coverage_fraction(
    y_train,
    all_models["q 0.05"].predict(X_train),
    all_models["q 0.95"].predict(X_train),
)
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_kmeans_assumptions.ipynb
CONTEXT:  Possible solutions  For an example on how to find a correct number of blobs, see
`sphx_glr_auto_examples_cluster_plot_kmeans_silhouette_analysis.py`. In this case it suffices to set `n_clusters=3`.   COMMENT:
```python
y_pred = KMeans(n_clusters=3, **common_params).fit_predict(X)
plt.scatter(X[:, 0], X[:, 1], c=y_pred)
plt.title("Optimal Number of Clusters")
plt.show()
```

### notebooks/dataset2/clustering/plot_agglomerative_clustering.ipynb
CONTEXT:   Agglomerative clustering with and without structure  This example shows the effect of imposing a connectivity graph to capture local
structure in the data. The graph is simply the graph of 20 nearest neighbors.  There are two advantages of imposing a connectivity. First, clustering
with sparse connectivity matrices is faster in general.  Second, when using a connectivity matrix, single, average and complete linkage are unstable
and tend to create a few clusters that grow very quickly. Indeed, average and complete linkage fight this percolation behavior by considering all the
distances between two clusters when merging them ( while single linkage exaggerates the behaviour by considering only the shortest distance between
clusters). The connectivity graph breaks this mechanism for average and complete linkage, making them resemble the more brittle single linkage. This
effect is more pronounced for very sparse graphs (try decreasing the number of neighbors in kneighbors_graph) and with complete linkage. In
particular, having a very small number of neighbors in the graph, imposes a geometry that is close to that of single linkage, which is well known to
have this percolation instability.  COMMENT: Create a graph capturing local connectivity. Larger number of neighbors will give more homogeneous
clusters to the cost of computation time. A very large number of neighbors gives more evenly distributed cluster sizes, but may not impose the local
manifold structure of the data

                linkage=linkage, connectivity=connectivity, n_clusters=n_clusters
            )
            t0 = time.time()
            model.fit(X)
            elapsed_time = time.time() - t0
